We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effects of stimulant and non-stimulant medications ![](km0umgcx.011.png) on  autonomic  functioning  in  people  with  ADHD (PROSPERO:  CRD42020212439).  We  searched (9th August 2021) PsycInfo, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library, for randomised and non-randomised studies reporting indices of autonomic activity, (electrodermal, pupillometry and cardiac), pre- 

and  post-medication exposure  in  people  meeting  DSM/ICD  criteria  for  ADHD. In  the  narrative  syntheses,  we included 5 electrodermal studies, 1 pupillometry study and 57 studies investigating heart rate and blood pres-

sure. In the meta-analyses, 29 studies were included on blood pressure and 32 on heart rate. Administration of stimulants, and to a lesser degree, non-stimulants increased heart rate and blood pressure in people with ADHD. 

Similarly,  an  upregulation  of  arousal,  reflected  in  increased  electrodermal  activity  and  pupil  diameter  was observed following stimulant use. Yet, the methodological diversity of studies presented in this review reinforces 

the  need  for  more  standardised  and  rigorous  research  to  fully  understand  the  relationship  between  arousal, medication, and behaviour in ADHD.   

1. **Introduction** 

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  is  a  neuro - developmental  condition  characterised  by  developmentally  inappro - priate,  persistent,  and  impairing  levels  of  inattention  and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity  ([American  Psychiatric  Association,  2013).](#_page25_x306.60_y663.00) Alongside  these  core  symptoms,  individuals  with  ADHD also  exhibit signs  of arousal dysregulation. Arousal  is characterised by the  physio - logical  mechanisms  associated  with  alertness,  wakefulness,  and  reac- tivity  to  the  environment  ([Lacey,  1967),](#_page27_x37.61_y683.42)  and  it  is  governed  by interactions  between  the  central  and  peripheral  nervous  systems. Notably,  the  autonomic  nervous  system  (ANS) forms  one  part  of  the peripheral nervous system and is a vital regulatory system comprising of two  branches:  the  sympathetic  nervous  system  (SNS)  and  the  para - sympathetic nervous system (PNS). 

While  the  SNS is considered  an  accelerator  system  associated  with 

mobilising resources (i.e., fight-or-flight response, increases in heart rate and pupil dilation in response to threat), the PNS is a decelerator system responsible for relaxation (i.e., rest-and-digest, lowering heart rate). To maintain  homeostasis,  both  branches  of  the  ANS  work  together  to modulate  physiological  arousal  to  meet  environmental  demands  and this autonomic balance plays a key role in self-regulation and attentional processing  ([Quadt  et  al.,  2022).](#_page27_x306.60_y675.45)  Autonomic  dysfunction  in  ADHD is often  reported  in  the  form  of  under-  or  hypo-arousal  (e.g.,  reduced electrodermal activity and heart rate) and weaker arousal regulation (e. g., reduced heart  rate variability) (see reviews by [Bellato et al., 2020; ](#_page26_x37.61_y149.42)and  [Robe  et  al.,  2019),](#_page28_x37.61_y77.69)  although  its  underlying physiological  mecha - nisms are contested. 

Disturbances in autonomic arousal are also reflected in the comor -

bidity of ADHD with other conditions including sleep disorders, allergies and  asthma,  problems  regulating  appetite,  and  hypertension ([Faraone et al., 2021).](#_page26_x306.60_y691.40) Additionally, hypo-arousal in ADHD may explain some of

the  hallmark  behaviours  of  ADHD  such  as  inattention  and  hyper - active/impulsive behaviours. Namely,  a failure  to  appropriately upre - gulate  or  increase  arousal  in  ADHD  may  result  in  difficulties  in responding  flexibly  to  moment-to-moment  changes  in  task  and/or environmental demands, giving rise to atypical allocation of attentional resources  and  reduced  vigilance  ([Dupuy  et  al.,  2014;  Geissler  et  al., 2014).](#_page26_x306.60_y460.26) In a similar vein, hyperactive and impulsive behaviours may be viewed as compensatory mechanisms employed to create a more stim- ulating  environment  and  elevate  a  generally  hypo-aroused  state ([Geissler  et  al.,  2014).](#_page27_x37.61_y292.89)  Consequently, ADHD symptomatology may  be associated with difficulties in the regulation of autonomic functioning, representing  one  possible  aetiological  pathway  to  the  condition. Nevertheless,  the  underlying  mechanisms  or  systems  supporting  the relationship  between  autonomic arousal  and  cognition  remains  to  be established. 

Among  the  different  autonomic  systems  involved  in  arousal  and attention, the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system is likely to 

play a primary role. The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small nucleus situated 

in  the  brainstem  and  it  is  the  main  source  of  noradrenaline  (NA) throughout the cortex ([Bast et al., 2018). The](#_page26_x37.61_y101.60) LC also projects to the ANS ([Sara, 2009) ](#_page28_x37.61_y221.15)with peripheral indices of autonomic arousal (heart rate; [Matthews et al., 2004, ](#_page27_x306.60_y197.24)electrodermal activity; Zhang[ et al., 2013; pupil ](#_page28_x306.60_y635.60)dilation; [Murphy et al., 2014) ](#_page27_x306.60_y380.56)shown to correlate with activity in the LC 

or  its  afferent  targets  such  as the  anterior  cingulate  cortex  (ACC) and orbitofrontal  cortex  (OFC).  As  such,  the  LC  constitutes  a  pivotal component  of  the  brain’s global  arousal  state,  priming  the  brain  for effortful cognitive action. The adaptive gain theory conceptualises the LC-NA brain  system  as  a  biological  correlate  of the  inverted  U-shape relationship between levels of arousal and task performance (Yerkes and Dodson., 1908). Phasic NA release supports task-focused attention over 

time, whereas in situations where a stimulus is insufficiently rewarding, LC activity switches to a tonic mode in which incoming sensory infor- mation is prioritised, enabling disengagement from the current task and 

a search for alternative, more rewarding behaviours ([Aston-Jones et al., 2000).](#_page26_x37.61_y77.69) To maintain an optimal task-focused state, arousal levels must be monitored  and  adjusted  via  dynamic  transitions  between  tonic  and phasic modes of LC activity to coordinate behavioural strategies in line 

with  environmental  demands  ([Mather,  2016).](#_page27_x306.60_y181.30)  Given  the  widely distributed projections of the LC, its status as a neuromodulator, and role 

in  arousal,  atypical  functioning  of  the  LC-NA may  contribute  to  the higher-level cognitive functions often impaired in ADHD ([Geissler et al., 2014;](#_page27_x37.61_y292.89) [Kuntsi and Klein, 2012; ](#_page27_x37.61_y659.51)[Sara and Bouret, 2012; ](#_page28_x37.61_y237.10)[Sergeant, 2000). ](#_page28_x37.61_y324.77)

Studies objectively measuring arousal levels via heart rate, electro - dermal activity and pupillometry indices (which are indirect measures of autonomic arousal, see [Table 1 for](#_page2_x37.61_y51.56) a summary) have found evidence of autonomic arousal dysfunction in ADHD during cognitive tasks (i.e., attention,  inhibitory  control,  working  memory)  and  at  rest  ([Bellato et  al.,  2020).](#_page26_x37.61_y149.42)  Interestingly,  ADHD medications  have  been  found  to improve cognitive deficits often observed in people with ADHD, such as increased  intra-individual reaction  time  variability  (RTV) ([Castellanos and Tannock, 2002), ](#_page26_x37.61_y476.20)a potential marker of impaired arousal regulation, which  reflects  fluctuations  in performance as a result of difficulties  in maintaining  optimal  vigilance  and  motor  control  ([Sergeant,  2005).](#_page28_x37.61_y348.68) [Epstein  et  al.  (2011) ](#_page26_x306.60_y516.05) found  ADHD medications  significantly  reduced RTV in  medication-naïve children  with  ADHD across  multiple  neuro - psychological tasks. This suggests that pharmacological treatments may upregulate arousal levels  in people  with ADHD and  this may  result in improvements in cognitive function, although the precise role of arousal in cognitive processing remains to be established (Young[ et al., 2017). ](#_page28_x306.60_y555.90)

Pharmacological  interventions  for  ADHD include  stimulant  (e.g., methylphenidate  and  amphetamines),  and  non-stimulant  medications (e.g.,  atomoxetine  and  extended  release  guanfacine)  with  the  former typically  offered  as the  first-line  treatment for ADHD ([Cortese,  2020). ](#_page26_x306.60_y101.60)Neurobiological accounts of ADHD view the condition to be a result of dysfunctional neurotransmitter systems, specifically dopaminergic and noradrenergic  systems  ([Cortese  et  al.,  2018;  Faraone  and  Larsson, ](#_page26_x306.60_y165.36)

[2019).](#_page26_x306.60_y165.36) In light of this, it is speculated that ADHD medications improve cognitive  processing  (e.g.,  reducing  RTV;  [Epstein  et  al.,  2011)](#_page26_x306.60_y516.05)  by increasing the release of these neurotransmitters at cortical sites (Adler 

[et al., 2005; Del Campo et al., 2011). ](#_page25_x306.60_y431.87)Specifically, stimulant medications block the reuptake of dopamine, and to a lesser degree noradrenaline, increasing  concentration of these  neurotransmitters in  pre-frontal  sys- tems ([Faraone, 2018). ](#_page26_x306.60_y619.66)In contrast, non-stimulants (like atomoxetine) are specific noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (see Table[ 2 for a ](#_page3_x37.61_y98.39)summary). Studies  on  animal  models  of ADHD have  shown  that  stimulants  (e.g., methylphenidate) increase  LC neuronal  activity,  promoting  release  of NA  and  increasing  autonomic  arousal,  and  this  is  accompanied  by reduced behavioural hyperactivity ([Devilbiss and Berridge, 2006; Kha-](#_page26_x306.60_y372.59)

[ras et al., 2017). ](#_page26_x306.60_y372.59)

Although  studies  investigating  the  effects  of  medication  on  ANS functioning  in  humans  are  scarce,  it  could  be  reasoned  that  ADHD medications  which  influence  LC activity,  exert a sympathomimetic ef- fect  which  results  in  cardiovascular and  other  autonomic-related side effects  ([Vitiello  et  al.,  2012;  Faraone  and  Buitelaar,  2010).](#_page28_x306.60_y109.57)  In  fact, increased LC activation has been associated with increases in heart rate, electrodermal activity  and  pupil  dilation  ([Costa  and  Rudebeck,  2016; Murphy et al., 2014; Samuels and Szabadi, 2008; Sara and Bouret, 2012; Wang et al., 2014).](#_page26_x306.60_y221.15) Moreover, some of the most common adverse effects reported in people with ADHD taking stimulant or non-stimulant med- ications have been related to autonomic arousal, including increases in 

heart rate, loss of appetite and sleep dysregulation ([Cortese et al., 2013). ](#_page26_x306.60_y117.54)Indeed, previous research investigating the effects of ADHD medications 

on autonomic function have focused on unwanted side effects or effects on  cardiac  health  to  understand  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  these medications for use in ADHD ([Faraone and Buitelaar, 2010). Although](#_page26_x306.60_y651.54) informative, more systematic research is needed to investigate the spe-

cific  impact  of  ADHD  medications  on  the  functioning  of  the  ANS. Additionally, very few studies have directly assessed arousal regulation 

in ADHD in response to medications using objective measures of arousal 

(i.e., electrodermal activity). In their systematic review of the literature, [Bellato et al. (2020) briefly](#_page26_x37.61_y149.42) summarised findings from a small subset of studies  (n  = 6)  investigating the  impact  of ADHD medication  on  pe- ripheral  indices  of autonomic  arousal.  [Bellato  et  al.  (2020) ](#_page26_x37.61_y149.42) found  evi- dence that stimulant medication appeared to increase a general state of hypo-arousal in people with ADHD. However, examining the effects of ADHD medications on ANS functioning was not the main aim of their review  and  the  studies  presented  were  limited  (e.g.,  one  medication 

type:  methylphenidate)  and  methodologically  diverse.  As  such,  the current  study  aimed  to  systematically  investigate  and  summarise  the literature on  the  effects,  if any,  of stimulant  and  non-stimulant medi- cations on autonomic arousal in ADHD. 

We  explored  studies  investigating  autonomic  activity  in  children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD prior to and after the administration of a pharmacological intervention. Studies including objective measures of arousal, in the form of heart rate, pupillometry, and/or electrodermal activity were included in this study, irrespective of the aims of the study in which they were reported (e.g., as part of treatment safety outcomes). In  this  review,  we  explored  cardiac,  pupillometry  and  electrodermal activity as outcome measures of arousal as they provide useful measures of changes in autonomic arousal over time and under specific conditions (see [Table 1 ](#_page2_x37.61_y51.56)for summary). We predicted that if atypical arousal regu-

lation,  predominantly in  the  direction  of hypo-arousal, is a feature  of ADHD (as  suggested  by  previous  research),  and  if ADHD medications increase  autonomic  functioning,  then  the  administration  of  ADHD medications will be associated with an up-regulation, ‘normalisation’ or return to an autonomic balance of ANS functioning. The results from this study will help shed light on the clinical implications of pharmacological interventions on ANS functioning, over and above those describing the impact  of  ADHD  pharmacology  on  autonomic  related  side  effects. Fundamentally, a better understanding of the functioning of the ANS in ADHD and the role of ADHD medications in influencing this system may increase our knowledge on the mechanisms underpinning this condition

Stimulant  Acts by blocking the reuptake of 

dopamine and noradrenaline in pre- frontal systems. 

Stimulant  Increases presynaptic release of 

dopamine and other biogenic amines in the brain 

Non-stimulant  A selective NA reuptake inhibitor; 

increases extra-cellular synaptic levels 

of NA and DA in pre-frontal cortex. Non-stimulant  Stimulates post-synaptic  2-adrenergic 

receptors 

Non-stimulant  ₂-adrenergic agonist 

The effectiveness of MPH has been attributed to its ability to increase levels of arousal in the central and autonomic nervous system, compatible with the hypo-arousal model of ADHD. 

Similar to MPH, amphetamines work to increase levels of arousal, including heart rate and blood pressure. 

Increases NA release to improve cognitive functioning and increase arousal levels. Typically results in reduced blood pressure and heart rate. 

Decreases heart rate and blood pressure 

Decreases NA release and inhibits LC activity. Also decreases heart rate and blood pressure.

a National guidelines in several countries recommend the use of stimulants as first-line treatments for moderate to severe ADHD symptoms in children and ado- lescents aged 6 years and over, and adults (refer to [Groom and Cortese, 2022 for more](#_page27_x37.61_y324.77) detailed information). Non-stimulant medications are often recommended for children, adolescents and adults with ADHD who do not respond well to or have contraindications to stimulant medications (Huchison et al., 2016; Groom and [Cortese, 2022).](#_page27_x37.61_y324.77)<a name="_page3_x37.61_y333.31"></a> Non-stimulants can be used as monotherapy or adjunctive to stimulants. 

b Most common autonomic related adverse effects for stimulants include small increases in heart rate and blood pressure, appetite loss and sleep disturbances. In contrast, non-stimulants have been associated with reduced heart rate and somnolence (Cortese et[ al., 2013). ](#_page26_x306.60_y117.54)

2. **Methods** 

This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the 2020 PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines  ([Page  et  al.,  2021)](#_page27_x306.60_y595.75) (see  PRISMA Checklist,  Supplement  1). The protocol was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020212439). 

1. *Search strategy* 

We systematically searched  PsycInfo,  MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web  of Science and The Cochrane Library databases (date of search: 9th August 2021), without any language or date limits. The search strategy included keywords  relating  to  ADHD, pharmacological  interventions,  and  the autonomic nervous system (ANS). These keywords were supplemented 

with terms used to measure a) ANS function (e.g., heart rate, pupil size and electrodermal activity) or b) to describe specific ADHD medications (e.g.,  methylphenidate,  Ritalin  and  Elvanse)  (see  Supplement  2  for additional details). The search was updated on 13th October 2022. One 

study ([Morris et al., 2022), ](#_page27_x306.60_y348.68)investigating the effects of methylphenidate on electrodermal activity in adolescents with ADHD, was found from the updated search and was included in the narrative review. 

2. *Selection criteria* 

The  following  criteria  were  used  to  assess  whether  studies  were eligible  for  inclusion:  (1)  empirical  studies  in  which  indices  of  auto - nomic arousal were collected before and after the initiation of a phar - macological  intervention  for  ADHD  (defined  as  stimulant  or  non- stimulant medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); (2) including people of any age meeting DSM (III, III-R, IV (TR), V) or ICD (9, 10) diagnostic criteria for ADHD; (3) no additional medi- cations taken during the study period (i.e., to treat a co-occurring con- dition);  (4)  implementation  of  a  washout  period,  when  applicable. 

Studies  were  included  if autonomic  activity  was  assessed  before  and after stimulant and/or non-stimulant medication exposure, irrespective of  study  design  (e.g.,  randomised,  non-randomised  controlled  trial), comparative  treatment  (e.g.,  placebo,  stimulant/non-stimulant  medi- cation) or comparative group (clinical, neurotypical controls). Although we  did  not  include  previous  systematic  or  narrative  reviews,  we searched reference lists to identify additional eligible studies. 

3. *Data selection, extraction, and coding* 

To identify  studies  that  potentially met  our  inclusion  criteria,  the titles, and abstracts of studies obtained from the search were screened independently  by  two  authors  (II  and  AB). Any  disagreements  were resolved  through  discussion.  The  full  texts  of  each  article  marked  as eligible for inclusion were assessed (see Supplement 3 for a full list of records excluded after full-text screening). Data relevant to the current study  were  extracted  from  eligible  studies  by  one  author  (II)  using  a standardised form, and then cross-checked by another author (AB) for accuracy. Extracted data included: study design, study population (age, sex,  socio-demographic  details),  clinical  characteristics  (method  of ascertaining  clinical  diagnosis,  co-occurring  conditions),  details  of pharmacological  intervention  (medication  type,  length  of  treatment, previous  medication  use,  washout  period)  and  outcome  measures (autonomic measure used (i.e., pupillometry, heart rate, electrodermal activity),  means  and  standard  deviations  (SD)  pre-  and  post- medication).  Data  unavailable  from  studies  were  sought  from  corre - sponding, first, or senior authors via email. 

4. *Outcomes and assessment of study quality* 

We  planned  to  consider  any  index  of  ANS functioning,  such  as pupillometry,  electrodermal  activity  or  heart  rate.  Although  blood pressure was not amongst the main outcome measures outlined in our protocol and search, we extracted data relating to these values – as post- 

hoc  outcome  measures  – since  they  are  measured  routinely  in  clinics, along with heart rate/heart rate variability measurements, and provide 

a more  complete  view  of cardiovascular functioning  in ADHD partici - pants in response to medications. 

Study  quality  was  rated  by  two  authors  (II  and  AB) using  tools appropriate for  each  study  type.  Tools  included  the  Cochrane  risk-of- bias  tool  for  randomised  trials  (RoB 2)  ([Sterne  et  al.,  2019),](#_page28_x37.61_y508.08)  Risk  of Bias In Non-Randomised Studies  - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) ([Sterne ](#_page28_x37.61_y484.17)

[et al., 2016),](#_page28_x37.61_y484.17) National Institute of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool 

for Observational Cohort Studies ([National Institutes of Health, 2014) or ](#_page27_x306.60_y404.47)NIH  Quality  Assessment  Tool  for  Case-Control  Studies  ([National  In- stitutes of Health, 2014) ](#_page27_x306.60_y404.47)(see [Tables 3, 4, 6 and 8 for ](#_page4_x37.61_y216.16)more details). 

5. *Data synthesis and analysis* 

We  qualitatively  synthesised  studies  investigating  the  effects  of 

ADHD medications on electrodermal activity, pupil size and studies on heart  rate  and  blood  pressure  for  which  meta-analyses  could  not  be performed.  For  studies  that  reported  mean  and  SD of  pre-post  inter - vention changes in heart rate and blood pressure, measured in relation 

to medication and placebo, the standardized mean difference (Hedge’s g) was calculated. For studies that reported raw data (i.e., mean and SD of heart rate and blood pressure, for pre-and post-intervention, in rela- tion to medication and placebo), we used such data to calculate Hedge’s g.  Multi-level  random-effects meta-analytic models  were  fitted  to  the data  (when  there  were  at  least  two  effect  sizes  from  two  independent studies  available  for  each  measure)  in *metafor*  (*R 4.1.0;*  [R Core  Team, 2021),](#_page27_x306.60_y699.36)  with  effect  sizes  nested  within  studies  for  those  that  reported multiple  effect  sizes  for  the  same  component  to  account  for non-independence of data (multivariate models).

Thirty-three studies were included in the meta-analyses (32 in the meta- analysis  on  heart  rate,  29  in  the  meta-analysis on  blood  pressure,  no studies  of electrodermal activity  or  pupillometry were  eligible  for  in- clusion  in  meta-analysis).  For  the  narrative  synthesis,  we  grouped studies  into  those  reporting;  a)  electrodermal activity  b)  pupil  size  c) cardiovascular functioning including heart rate and blood pressure. Five studies  were  included  in  the  narrative  synthesis  investigating electro - dermal  activity,  one  study  investigating  pupil  size,  and  fifty-seven studies  were  included  in  the  narrative  synthesis  of  studies  investi - gating cardiovascular functioning. In the following sections, we report 

the  results  of  the  meta-analyses  and  narrative  syntheses,  grouped  by autonomic measure and medication type. 

1. *Effects of ADHD medications on electrodermal activity* 

The  impact  of stimulant  medications, specifically  methylphenidate (MPH), on electrodermal activity (EDA) was investigated in five studies. As a meta-analysis could not be conducted on these studies (effect sizes could not be computed for most of them), they were all included in the narrative synthesis (Table 3). 

1. *Narrative synthesis on the effects of ADHD medications on EDA during rest* 

   Three  studies  ([Hermens  et  al.,  2005;  Negrao  et  al.,  2011;  Morris et al., 2022)](#_page27_x37.61_y452.29) examined changes in EDA following treatment with MPH at 

   rest and found conflicting results. [Negrao et al. (2011) found](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29) evidence of a  small  difference  when  comparing  pre-treatment/baseline  skin conductance  (SC)  between  stimulant-free  children  with  ADHD  and control  children,  with  SC found  to  be  lower  in  stimulant-free  ADHD children  indicative  of  baseline  disturbances  in  autonomic  arousal. Further to this, SC was higher in children with ADHD when they were on-medication relative to off-medication, and there were no differences 

   in  SC between  control  children  and  those  with  ADHD on-medication, suggesting  increased  sympathetic  arousal  following  treatment  with MPH  in  ADHD.  However,  these  results  should  be  interpreted  with caution  given  the  limitations inherent  within  this  study  (i.e.,  a  small sample size and poorly controlled study design). Nevertheless, a recent 

   study by [Morris et al. (2022) addressed](#_page27_x306.60_y348.68) the limitations of Negrao[ et al. (2011) ](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29)by employing a large sample of ADHD participants (controlling 

   for  co-morbidities,  a  limitation  of  other  studies  reported  here)  and exploring  medication  effects  within  a  rigorous  study  design  (with - in-subjects, double-masked, cross-over design). Their results were in line 

   with  those  by  [Negrao  et  al.  (2011). ](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29) Notably,  adolescents  with  ADHD exhibited  reduced  EDA in  the  placebo  condition,  relative  to  typical controls and the administration of osmotic release oral system (OROS) 

   MPH,  a  long-acting  formulation  of  MPH,  reduced  these  group  differ- ences. Conversely, [Hermens et al. (2005) found](#_page27_x37.61_y452.29) greater non-specific skin conductance response (ns-SCR) amplitude during rest in ADHD partic - ipants off-medication relative to controls. This finding does not support previous  observations of hypo-arousal in  ADHD. Furthermore, ns-SCR amplitude did not differ pre- and post-MPH administration, indicating 

   a different autonomic profile in this study compared with the studies of Negrao, and Morris. 

2. *Narrative synthesis on the effects of ADHD medications on EDA during a cognitive task* 

   Four studies investigated the effects of stimulant medication on EDA during  a  cognitive  task  (response  inhibition  task:  [Broyd  et  al.,  2005;](#_page26_x37.61_y348.68) attentional tasks: [Hermens et al., 2005; ](#_page27_x37.61_y452.29)[Negrao et al., 2011; ](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29)[Lawrence ](#_page27_x306.60_y93.63)

   [et al., 2005).](#_page27_x306.60_y93.63) 

During an auditory cued Go/Nogo task, [Broyd et al. (2005) used](#_page26_x37.61_y348.68) EDA 

to examine the global effects of MPH on arousal levels. Prior to medi- cation use, adolescents with ADHD displayed lower SC relative to con-

trols, and the administration of MPH resulted in a subsequent increase in SC,  attenuating  any  group  differences  between  ADHD  and  control groups  (as  [Negrao  et  al.,  2011,](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29)  found  for  resting  state).  Interestingly, 

[Broyd  et  al.  (2005) ](#_page26_x37.61_y348.68) also  reported  a similar  pattern  of changes  in  task performance  measures  following  medication  use.  Specifically,  MPH appeared to normalise the difference between children with ADHD and controls in relation to commission errors, although this was not the case 

with omission errors. 

[Lawrence  et  al.  (2005) ](#_page27_x306.60_y93.63)found  unmedicated children with  ADHD to display  lower  SC relative  to  controls,  with  this  difference  no  longer present following medication intake (due to increased SC). In line with findings  from  [Broyd  et  al.  (2005), ](#_page26_x37.61_y348.68) [Lawrence  et  al.  (2005) ](#_page27_x306.60_y93.63) found  boys with ADHD initially committed more errors when compared to controls, although this difference was no longer present following medication use suggesting  specific  improvements  in  inhibitory  processing  following medication use. 

[Hermens  et  al.  (2005) ](#_page27_x37.61_y452.29) found  a decrease  in SC over  time  during  an auditory oddball task in adolescents with ADHD when off-medication, but  the  administration of MPH helped  to  maintain  SC at  a more  con- stant  level  throughout the  task.  However,  unlike  previous  studies,  the effects of medication use on SC were not paralleled by changes in task performance  indices.  Pre-medication,  [Hermens  et  al.  (2005) ](#_page27_x37.61_y452.29) found poorer task performance in adolescents with ADHD relative to controls, 

as reflected in longer reaction times, increased RTV and errors during an oddball  task.  Administration of MPH resulted  in  improvements in  re- action  time  and  errors  in  children  with  ADHD,  although  these  im- provements  did  not  reach  significance  and  were  still  increased  when compared to controls. 

Lastly, [Negrao et al. (2011) found](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29) unmedicated children with ADHD 

had greater SC during a focused attention task compared to resting-state, but  this  difference  was  not  present  anymore  when  on-medication. However,  in  their  paper  they  did  not  report  or  directly  compare  SC measured  during  the  focused  attention  task,  in  ADHD  children on-medication versus off-medication, making it difficult to interpret any treatment-related effects on autonomic functioning during the cognitive 

task. 

3. *Summary of EDA findings* 

Most of the studies included in this review found evidence of reduced EDA in people with ADHD prior to treatment, indicating hypo-arousal of 

the  SNS (as  EDA exclusively  reflects  sympathetic  activation)  which increased following treatment with MPH. Similar to the ways in which MPH appears to upregulate arousal, as indicated by the EDA findings, it 

also  appears  to  have  comparable  effects  on  cognitive  performance measures. 

2. *Effects of ADHD medications on pupillometry indices* 

*3.2.1. Narrative synthesis on the effects of ADHD medications on pupil indices* 

Only  one  study  investigated potential  differences  pupillary  indices during  a  visuo-spatial  task  whilst  children  with  ADHD  were  on- medication  and  off-medication  ([Wainstein  et  al.,  2017).](#_page28_x306.60_y149.42)  When off-medication, children with ADHD showed a reduced pupil diameter in response  to  task-relevant  stimuli  (i.e.,  probe  presentation),  when compared  to  neurotypical  controls,  but  this  group  difference  was  no longer  evident  when  children  were  on-medication  (because  pupil diameter  in  response  to  task-relevant  stimuli  increased  when  ADHD children were on-medication compared to off-medication). This suggests 

that  treatment  with  MPH  increased  task-evoked  pupil  responses  to target  stimuli  in  ADHD participants, resulting  in  responses  that  were comparable with typical controls. However, it should be noted that the 

change in pupillary dynamics during the task and in response to medi- cation was not accompanied by better task performance when children were on-medication relative to off-medication. 

3. *Effects of stimulant medications on cardiovascular functioning* Sixty-four  studies  investigated the  effects  of stimulant  medications 

on  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure  and  were  included  either  in  the narrative  synthesis  or  in  the  meta-analyses ([Table  4).](#_page5_x37.61_y51.56)  We present  the results  for each  type  of stimulant  medication  in separate  sub-sections, and  within  each  subsection,  we  present  first  the  results  of  the  meta- analysis,  and  then  the  findings  from  narrative  synthesis  of studies  not eligible for inclusion in meta-analysis. 

The meta-analyses investigating the effects of all stimulant medica -

tions  together  found  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the effects of stimulant medication vs placebo on HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), with higher mean values on 

these measures after intervention with stimulant medication compared to placebo (heart rate: Hedge’s g *>* 0.3467, p *<* 0.001; SBP: Hedge’s g *>* 0.1021, p *<* 0.0021; DBP: Hedge’s g *>* 0.1332, p *<* 0.0032; full results reported  in  [Table  5](#_page15_x23.04_y0.00)). Cross-study  heterogeneity was  significant  for  all meta-analyses;  hence  we  carried  out  additional  subgroup  and  meta- regression analyses to determine possible causes of heterogeneity. 

We found a significant moderating effect of Duration of Treatment on heart rate, SBP and DBP, with longer duration of treatment associated with  reduced  effect of stimulant medication, compared to  placebo, on these measures. No significant moderating effect of developmental stage (Children vs Adults) was found for heart rate, SBP or DBP. However, for 

the meta-analysis on DBP, effect sizes calculated from raw data reported 

in the papers (mean and SD pre- and post-intervention, for medication and  non-medication) were  generally  lower than  those  calculated from mean  and  standard  deviation  of the  pre/post-intervention differences reported in the papers (results of these analyses are reported in Table [5). ](#_page15_x23.04_y0.00)Thirty-eight studies were included in the narrative synthesis since effect sizes for these studies could not be computed. Findings of meta-analyses carried out for each medication, are presented in the next paragraphs. 

1. *Methylphenidate (MPH)* 
1. *Meta-analyses  on  the  effects  of  MPH  on  cardiovascular functioning.* We  found  a  statistically  significantly  higher  increase  in heart  rate,  SBP and  DBP after  MPH intervention compared  to  placebo (heart rate: Hedge’s g = 0.4185, p *<* 0.001; SBP: Hedge’s g = 0.1166, 

   p = 0.0060; DBP: Hedge’s g = 0.1444, p = 0.0159; [Table 5; forest](#_page15_x23.04_y0.00) plots reported in Supplement 4). Cross-study heterogeneity was significant for 

   the meta-analyses on heart rate and DBP, and publication bias was not 

   detected. 

2. *Narrative  synthesis  on  the  effects  of  MPH  on  cardiovascular functioning.* Of  the  studies  included  in  the  narrative  synthesis,  four studies  administered OROS MPH in  children  and/or adolescents  ([Cho ](#_page26_x37.61_y524.02)

   [et al., 2012; Gau et al., 2006; Wilens et al., 2004) and](#_page26_x37.61_y524.02) adults with ADHD ([Adler et al., 2011).](#_page25_x306.60_y527.51) Three studies found no significant changes in blood pressure indices after treatment with OROS MPH (Adler[ et al., 2011; Cho ](#_page25_x306.60_y527.51)

   [et al., 2012; Gau et al., 2006) ](#_page25_x306.60_y527.51)whereas one study found OROS MPH to be associated  with  significant  increases  in  SBP and  DBP after  3-,  6-  and 12-months of treatment ([Wilens et al., 2004). Most](#_page28_x306.60_y428.38) studies also reported 

   a moderate increase in heart rate from pre-treatment to post-treatment with  OROS MPH  which  is  consistent  with  our  meta-analysis  and  the known effects of stimulant medications on cardiac function (Adler[ et al., 2011; Cho et al., 2012; Wilens et al., 2004). ](#_page25_x306.60_y527.51)

In their study, [Gau et al. (2006) ](#_page27_x37.61_y261.01)compared the efficacy of OROS MPH 

in  comparison to  immediate release  (IR)  MPH in  Taiwanese  children with ADHD. They found that heart rate and blood pressure indices did not  significantly  increase  as a function  of MPH, in  either  IR or  OROS formulations. In contrast, [Wilens et al. (2004) assessed](#_page28_x306.60_y428.38) the cardiac safety profile of OROS MPH over a period of 12 months. When compared  to pre-treatment  vital  sign  measurements,  they  found  treatment  with OROS MPH to be associated with significant increases in heart rate, SBP 

and DBP at months 3, 6, 9 and 12, although there were no differences in 

any of these measures by dose levels of OROS MPH. They also found an inverse  relationship  between  pre-treatment  vital  sign  values  and  the 

change  in  vital  signs  post-treatment with  higher  heart  rate  and  blood pressure  values  at  baseline  associated  with  the  least  change  in  these measures  post-treatment. This  finding  may  reflect  a  regression  to  the mean  or  else,  adolescents  with  inherently  higher  vital  sign  measure - ments  appear  to  present  the  least  amount  of  change  after  treatment. Further to this, blood pressure indices increased with age, but heart rate 

tended to decrease with increasing age, although the lack of a placebo comparison group makes it difficult to interpret whether this pattern of results  are  attributable  to  age/developmental  changes  or  treatment emergent effects specifically. 

Sixteen studies investigated the effects of short-acting MPH on heart 

rate and/or blood pressure (see [Table 4). Most](#_page5_x37.61_y51.56) studies reported no sig- nificant  changes in heart  rate  after treatment with MPH ([Aman et  al., 1991, 1993; Brown and Sexson, 1988; Ilgenli et al., 2007; Omidi et al., ](#_page25_x306.60_y639.09)

(2015) found heart rate 

to increase over time, contrary to previous studies ([Wilens et al., 2004). ](#_page28_x306.60_y428.38)There was also evidence of a correlation between heart rate and SBP at follow-up,  suggesting  that  treatment  with  MPH  affected  overall  car- diovascular functioning. 

Heart  rate  variability  (HRV)  (see  [Table  1 ](#_page2_x37.61_y51.56) for  a  summary  of  HRV measures) was evaluated in four studies following treatment with MPH ([Dogra et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2015; Negrao et al., 2011; Ozcan et al., 2004).](#_page26_x306.60_y436.35) [Negrao et al. (2011) carried](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29) out a cross-sectional comparison of children  with  and  without  ADHD on  measures  of  HRV. They  found stimulant-free children  with ADHD showed  greater  values in high  fre- quency (HF) and Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) parameters when compared to typical controls prior to treatment. This indicates that children with ADHD vary relative to controls in the initial HRV parameters  before  treatment  supporting  the  notion  of  atypical autonomic  activity  in  ADHD. Given  that  RMSSD and  HF reflect  para - sympathetically mediated HRV parameters, the authors reported para - sympathetic  hyper-arousal  (and  sympathetic  hypo-arousal)  in stimulant-free  children  with  ADHD  relative  to  neurotypicals.  The administration of MPH shifted the autonomic balance towards normal levels in children with ADHD. Although there was a normalisation effect 

of MPH on parasympathetic tone to some extent, [Negrao et al. (2011) ](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29)found  that  children  with  ADHD when  on-medication,  still  displayed underactivity of the  SNS, as  reflected  in  higher  SD2 values  (standard deviation of continuous long-term variability), when compared to con-

trols.  Overall,  this  pattern  of findings  was  interpreted to  reflect  MPH normalising the autonomic balance of children with ADHD but since the 

level  of  sympathetic  arousal  in  ADHD children  on  medication  is still found to be lower than that of control subjects, this autonomic balance is 

not  achieved.  Nevertheless,  findings  from  this  study  should  be  inter - preted with caution. Whilst [Negrao et al. (2011) suggests](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29) that ADHD is characterised by parasympathetic dominance, findings from other HRV parameters  in  the  study,  arguably  more  reflective  of  the  autonomic balance from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance (i.e., ratio of 

low frequency (LF) to HF HRV (LF/HF)) were indicative of a sympathetic dominance in children with ADHD making the findings from this study challenging to interpret.

line  with  [Negrao  et  al.  (2011) ](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29) they  found  increased  HF and  RMSSD parameters in children with ADHD prior to medication which decreased after 12-weeks of treatment. However, a large number of male partici -

pants (34 male; 3 female) completed the study making generalisability to the ADHD population challenging. Nevertheless, Ozcan[ et al. (2004) ](#_page27_x306.60_y563.87)also found a decrease in RMSSD in patients with ADHD after interven -

tion with MPH. As such, children with ADHD tended to show a dominant parasympathetic system prior  to  medication  which  shifted towards  an autonomic balance following treatment. 

[Dogra et al. (2017) also](#_page26_x306.60_y436.35) found changes in autonomic functioning in males with ADHD after treatment with MPH. They found a statistically significant increase in LF and LF/HF ratio after 12 weeks of treatment reflecting enhanced sympathetic activity following treatment. Similar to 

[Kim  et  al.  (2015) ](#_page27_x37.61_y635.60) and  [Negrao  et  al.  (2011), ](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29) participants  exhibited decreased  HF and  RMSSD after  treatment  representing  a  decrease  in resting  parasympathetic  tone  and  again  a  shift  towards  finding  an autonomic balance after treatment. Nevertheless, Negrao[ et al. (2011) ](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29)

was  the  only  study  to  include  a  control  sample,  thereby  making  the interpretability of the findings problematic. 

2. *Amphetamines* 
1. *Meta-analyses  on  the  effects  of  lisdexamphetamine  dimesylate (LDX)  on  cardiovascular  functioning.* We  found  a  statistically  signifi- cantly  higher  increase  in  heart  rate,  but  not  SBP or  DBP, after  LDX intervention  compared  to  placebo  (heart  rate:  Hedge’s  g  = 0.3086, p = 0.0276;  SBP: Hedge’s g = 0.1086,  p = 0.4388;  DBP: Hedge’s g = 0.1911, p = 0.1927; full results reported in [Table 5; forest](#_page15_x23.04_y0.00) plots reported in Supplement 4). Cross-study heterogeneity was significant for all meta- analyses, and publication bias was not detected. 
1. *Narrative  synthesis  on  the  effects  of  LDX  on  cardiovascular functioning.* Eight  studies  measured  the  physiological  effects  of  LDX treatment via heart rate and blood pressure indices and were included in the  narrative  synthesis  ([Adler  et  al.,  2009b;](#_page25_x306.60_y495.63)  [Childress  et  al.,  2020; ](#_page26_x37.61_y500.11)[Coghill  et  al.,  2017;](#_page26_x37.61_y691.40) [Findling  et  al.,  2008; ](#_page27_x37.61_y93.63)[Hammerness  et  al.,  2013; ](#_page27_x37.61_y380.56)[Mattingly  et  al.,  2012;](#_page27_x306.60_y253.04) [Weisler  et  al.,  2009; ](#_page28_x306.60_y205.21)[Wigal  et  al.,  2010). ](#_page28_x306.60_y380.56) Four studies  included  adult  participants ([Adler  et  al.,  2009b; ](#_page25_x306.60_y495.63)[Hammerness ](#_page27_x37.61_y380.56)

   [et al., 2013; ](#_page27_x37.61_y380.56)[Mattingly et al., 2012; ](#_page27_x306.60_y253.04)[Weisler et al., 2009) and](#_page28_x306.60_y205.21) four studies included  children  and/or  adolescents  ([Childress  et  al.,  2020;  Coghill et al., 2017; Findling et al., 2008; Wigal et al., 2010). ](#_page26_x37.61_y500.11)

In adults with ADHD, there was some evidence of an increase in pulse 

and heart rate following treatment with LDX (Adler[ et al., 2009b; Mat- ](#_page25_x306.60_y495.63)[tingly  et  al.,  2012;](#_page27_x306.60_y253.04) [Weisler  et  al.,  2009).](#_page28_x306.60_y205.21)  [Weisler  et  al.  (2009)  ](#_page28_x306.60_y205.21)found greater increases in pulse rate and blood pressure for LDX-naïve subjects compared  to  those  who  had  received  LDX previously,  and  this  was attributed to  previous  LDX exposure  as  evidenced  by  higher  baseline pulse rate in adults prior-exposed to LDX. There is also some evidence of increased  SBP ([Mattingly  et  al.,  2012;  Weisler  et  al.,  2009)](#_page27_x306.60_y253.04) and  DBP ([Weisler et al., 2009) ](#_page28_x306.60_y205.21)post-treatment, although (Adler[ et al., 2009b) did ](#_page25_x306.60_y495.63)

not find significant differences in SBP and DBP following treatment with 

LDX at any dose (30 mg, 50 mg or 70 mg/d). One study did not find any significant  changes  in  heart  rate  or  blood  pressure  indices  following treatment with LDX ([Hammerness et al., 2013). ](#_page27_x37.61_y380.56)

In  children  and/or  adolescents  with  ADHD, two  studies  reported increases in heart rate and blood pressure following treatment with LDX ([Coghill  et  al.,  2017;  Findling  et  al.,  2008).](#_page26_x37.61_y691.40) Specifically,  [Coghill  et  al. (2017) ](#_page26_x37.61_y691.40)found that an increase in pulse rate was considered potentially clinically important in several participants, but this was evident at only one post-baseline visit suggesting that this event was temporary rather than  reflecting  lasting  increases  in  heart  rate.  One  study  reported  an increase in DBP and a decrease in pulse rate and SBP from baseline to 8-weeks post-treatment ([Childress et al., 2020). Although](#_page26_x37.61_y500.11) LDX is often related to elevated heart  rate, the findings from this study were inter - preted  as  relating  to  higher  baseline  vital  signs  in  a  subset  of 

participants. Participants displaying these higher baseline values tended to normalise during the study which resulted in an overall decrease from baseline in pulse rate. This is similar to findings from [Wilens et al. (2004) ](#_page28_x306.60_y428.38)described  previously.  Lastly,  one  study  reported  no  significant  differ- ences  in  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure  for  stimulant-naïve  and prior-exposed stimulant groups following 4–5 weeks of LDX treatment ([Wigal et al., 2010).](#_page28_x306.60_y380.56) Stimulant-naïve and prior stimulant groups showed similar  mean  heart  rate  values  at  both  baseline  and  at  the  end  of the study. 

3. *Meta-analyses  on the effects of mixed  amphetamine  salts (MAS) on  cardiovascular  functioning.* We  found  a  statistically  significantly higher  increase  in  heart  rate,  SBP and  DBP, after  MAS intervention compared to placebo (heart rate: Hedge’s g = 0.2863, p = 0.0029; SBP: Hedge’s g = 0.1177, p = 0.0016; DBP: Hedge’s g = 0.1678, p = 0.0155; full results reported in [Table 5; forest](#_page15_x23.04_y0.00) plots reported in Supplement 4). Cross-study heterogeneity was significant for the meta-analysis on heart rate, and publication bias was not detected. 
3. *Narrative  synthesis  on  the  effects  of  MAS  on  cardiovascular functioning.* Two studies investigated the impact of mixed amphetamine 

   salts  extended  release  (MAS XR) on  measures  of cardiovascular func- tioning  and  were  included  in  the  narrative  synthesis  ([Weisler  et  al., 2005; Wilens et al., 2005). ](#_page28_x306.60_y229.13)One study investigated the long-term effects 

   of  MAS XR on  cardiac  function  in  adults  with  ADHD ([Weisler  et  al., 2005).](#_page28_x306.60_y229.13)  Although  an  increase  in  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure  were evident post-treatment, this change was reportedly clinically insignifi -

   cant. It should be noted however, that some of the participants in this study  were  found  to  meet  criteria  for  clinically  significant  cardiovas - cular abnormalities (e.g., tachycardia) at some point during the study. Nevertheless,  the  extent  to  which  any  clinically  significant  event  was related  to  underlying  pathological  risks  (i.e.,  hypertension)  versus stimulant  therapy  was  not  established.  Lastly,  [Wilens  et  al.  (2005) ](#_page28_x306.60_y404.47)explored  changes  in  cardiovascular  parameters  over  a  short-term  (4 weeks) and long-term (6 month) period. They found small but statisti -

   cally significant increases in pulse rate and SBP in people taking MAS XR relative  to  placebo  in  the  short-term  study.  Similarly,  individuals exhibited increased pulse rate and SBP in the long-term study. 

4. *Combinations of stimulant medications on cardiovascular functioning* 
1. *Narrative synthesis on the effects of a combination of stimulant medications on cardiovascular functioning* 

   Four  studies  compared  the  effects  of two  or  more  stimulant  medi- cations  on  cardiac  indices  ([Conzelmann  et  al.,  2019;  Findling  et  al., 2001; Samuels et al., 2006; Vitiello et al., 2012) and](#_page26_x306.60_y77.69) were included in the narrative synthesis. In their study comparing the cardiovascular effects 

   of MPH and  Adderall  (ADL), [Findling  et  al.  (2001) ](#_page27_x37.61_y69.72) found  statistically significant increases in pulse rate and DBP following each treatment. 

Using  24-hour  ambulatory blood  pressure  measurements, [Samuels ](#_page28_x37.61_y141.45)

[et al. (2006) ](#_page28_x37.61_y141.45)measured indices of heart rate and blood pressure following treatment  with  either  MPH,  amphetamine  or  dextroamphetamine  in comparison  to  placebo.  Although  a  subgroup  analysis  of  different medications  was  not  performed,  participants  showed  significantly increased  total  DBP, waking  DBP and  total  heart  rate  during  active treatment periods  relative  to  placebo.  However,  the  small  sample  size (n = 11) included in this study limits the generalisability of these find-

ings. [Conzelmann et al. (2019) compared](#_page26_x306.60_y77.69) the effects of short-acting vs long-acting  psychostimulants on  cardiac  measures  and  did  not  find  a significant influence of psychostimulants on heart rate. For blood pres-

sure indices, however, DBP decreased more with long- as compared to short-acting stimulants and SBP decreased with longer treatment dura -

tion. Lastly, [Vitiello et al. (2012) ](#_page28_x306.60_y109.57)examined the long-term cardiovascular effects of stimulant treatments (MPH or amphetamines) in children with

ADHD over a period of 10 years. There was evidence of increased heart 

rate after 3- and 8-years of treatment, suggesting that continued treat - ment  with  stimulants  is accompanied by lasting  effects  on  these  mea- sures over time. Accordingly, medication-naïve participants consistently showed  lower  mean  heart  rate  reflecting  a  hypo-aroused state,  when compared  to  the  intensively  medicated  group.  Nevertheless,  this  dif- ference was not statistically significant at 10 years, potentially due to the small  number  of  participants  on  medication  at  that  point.  The  rela- tionship between stimulant medication use and elevations in heart rate 

was not driven by cumulative exposure to stimulants but rather current medication use. There were also no treatment effects on blood pressure indices. 

2. *Summary of stimulant medication findings* 

Our  meta-analyses  found  evidence  of  increased  cardiovascular functioning  (heart  rate  and  blood  pressure)  associated  with  stimulant use  vs  placebo.  These  findings  are  partly  supported  by  the  narrative synthesis,  which  highlighted  moderate  increases  in  heart  rate  (e.g., associated  with  long-acting  MPH)  and  found  less  clear  evidence  of changes in blood pressure associated  with MPH or MAS XR. Although 

the meta-analysis on LDX did not find an effect of developmental stage on  cardiovascular  measures,  the  narrative  review  found  studies  on adults to show a pattern of increased heart rate and blood pressure (in response to this type of amphetamine) relative to studies on children/ adolescents. In the narrative synthesis, studies also showed a consistent pattern of changes in HRV, specifically a reduction in parasympathetic activity, following treatment with MPH. 

5. *Effects of non-stimulant medications on cardiovascular functioning* 

Sixteen studies investigated the effects of non-stimulant medications on  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure  and  were  included  either  in  the narrative synthesis or in the meta-analyses ([Table 6). The](#_page18_x37.61_y51.56) meta-analyses investigating the  effects  of non-stimulant medication  did  not  find  any statistically significant difference between the effects of non-stimulant medication vs placebo  on  heart  rate,  SBP and  DBP (HR: Hedge’s g = 0.9941,  p = 0.2482;  SBP:  Hedge’s  g  =   0.0741,  p = 0.5536;  DBP: Hedge’s g = 0.6066, p = 0.2848; full results reported in Table[ 7). Cross-](#_page20_x37.61_y51.56) study heterogeneity was significant for all meta-analyses. However, we 

did not find a significant moderating effect of duration of treatment or developmental  stage.  Publication  bias  was  detected  for  the  meta- analyses on SBP. 

Eleven  studies  assessed  the  cardiac  safety  profile  of non-stimulant medications  ([Table  6](#_page18_x37.61_y51.56))  and  were  included  in  the  narrative  synthesis, since  effect sizes for these studies could not  be computed. All but  one study  ([Adler  et  al.,  2005)](#_page25_x306.60_y431.87)  included  children  and/or  adolescents  with ADHD. Detailed findings of meta-analyses and narrative review, for each 

type of non-stimulant, are presented in the next paragraphs. 

1. *Atomoxetine (ATX)* 
1. *Meta-analyses  on  the  effects  of  ATX  on  cardiovascular functioning.* We found a statistically significantly higher increase in SBP (but not HR or DBP) after ATX intervention compared to placebo (HR: Hedge’s g = 1.7220, p = 0.1926; SBP: Hedge’s g = 0.1831, p = 0.0463; DBP: Hedge’s g = 1.0994, p = 0.2519; full results reported in Table[ 7; ](#_page20_x37.61_y51.56)forest  plots  reported  in Supplement  4).  Cross-study  heterogeneity was significant for the meta-analyses on HR and DBP, and publication bias was detected for these meta-analyses (but not for the meta-analysis on SBP). 
1. *Narrative  synthesis  on  the  effects  of  ATX  on  cardiovascular functioning.* Cardiac  safety  profiles  following  ATX  treatment  were assessed in eight studies which were included in the narrative synthesis ([Adler et al., 2005; Durell et al., 2009; Ercan et al., 2013; Escobar et al., ](#_page25_x306.60_y431.87)

   [2005;](#_page25_x306.60_y431.87) [Michelson  et  al.,  2007; ](#_page27_x306.60_y284.92)[Sert  et  al.,  2012; ](#_page28_x37.61_y372.59)[Tanidir  et  al.,  2015; ](#_page28_x37.61_y524.02)[Trzepacz et al., 2008). ](#_page28_x37.61_y603.72)Of these, four studies reported a significant in- crease in heart rate following treatment (Adler[ et al., 2005; Durell et al., 2009; Escobar et al., 2005; Tanidir et al., 2015). Of ](#_page25_x306.60_y431.87)note, Tanidir[ et al. (2015) ](#_page28_x37.61_y524.02)investigated HRV in children with ADHD and found that during the  24-hour  electrocardiography  (ECG)  recording,  all  time  domain indices  (SDNN,  RMSSD, mRR,  pNN50,  SDNNi and  SDANN) changed significantly following ATX treatment. In line with findings from studies investigating  stimulant  medication  use,  children  exhibited  a  higher RMSSD value  prior  to  medication which  decreased  during  treatment. This  is  indicative  of  a  parasympathetic  dominance  before  treatment which  shifted towards an autonomic balance of ANS functioning after treatment  with  ATX, consistent  with  findings  reported  above  on  the effects of MPH on similar HRV parameters. 

   Two  studies  found  no  significant  changes  in  heart  rate  following treatment with ATX ([Ercan et al., 2013; Sert et al., 2012). Ercan](#_page26_x306.60_y555.90) [et al. (2013) ](#_page26_x306.60_y555.90) compared  ATX treatment  response  profiles  across  ADHD sub- types (inattentive and combined presentations) to stratify subgroups of people  who  might  benefit  more  from  ATX treatment. With  respect  to symptom management, those with ADHD combined presentation were found  to  respond  better  to  ATX relative  to  participants  exhibiting  a predominantly inattentive presentation. However, changes in heart rate and blood pressure prior to and following treatment were not analysed across  subgroups  of  participants,  making  it  difficult  to  interpret  the possible  impact  of ATX on  these  autonomic  measures  across  different ADHD presentations. 

   Regarding  blood  pressure  measures,  most  studies  reported  no  sig- nificant  differences  in  SBP or  DBP following  treatment  with  ATX in children and adolescents with ADHD ([Ercan et al., 2013; Escobar et al., ](#_page26_x306.60_y555.90)

   [2005; Sert et al., 2012; Tanidir et al., 2015). ](#_page26_x306.60_y555.90)However, a long-term study 

   of ATX treatment in adults with ADHD found an increase in SBP and DBP post-treatment ([Adler et  al., 2005). ](#_page25_x306.60_y431.87)These  heterogeneous results  could 

   be due to several factors including but not limited to a) differences in developmental  age  of  the  participants  included  in  the  study  or  b) treatment length. 

   [Michelson et al. (2007) and](#_page27_x306.60_y284.92) [Trzepacz et al. (2008) investigated](#_page28_x37.61_y603.72) the cardiac safety profile of ATX in relation to genotype metaboliser status (CYP2D6) in children and adolescents with ADHD. Both studies found a greater increase in heart rate for poor metabolisers when compared with extensive metabolisers and found no difference between these groups on SBP post-treatment. [Michelson et al. (2007) found](#_page27_x306.60_y284.92) a greater increase in DBP for poor metabolisers relative to extensive metabolisers following treatment with ATX, while [Trzepacz et al. (2008) did ](#_page28_x37.61_y603.72)not find any group differences across metabolic statuses in DBP. Any differences observed between groups may reflect a greater increase in noradrenergic tone in poor  metabolisers  or  else  differences  in  receptor  occupancy  at  the noradrenaline  transporter  which  may  have  resulted  in  more  variable fluctuations  in  plasma  drug  concentrations  in  extensive  metabolisers ([Michelson et al., 2007). ](#_page27_x306.60_y284.92)That is, the steady state of drug concentrations in poor  metabolisers persist  throughout the  day,  whereas  in extensive metabolisers, plasma  levels  fluctuate  more  dramatically and  therefore the drug effects on cardiovascular measures may be less reliably estab - lished in extensive metabolisers when observations fail to consider the timings of drug administration and measurements. 

2. *Guanfacine* 
1. *Meta-analyses  on  the  effects  of  guanfacine  on  cardiovascular functioning.* We did not find any statistically significant differences be- tween the effects of guanfacine intervention on heart rate, SBP or DBP, compared  to  placebo  (heart  rate:  Hedge’s g =   0.5103,  p = 0.1364; SBP: Hedge’s g =   0.3914,  p = 0.1929;  DBP: Hedge’s g =   0.2578, p = 0.3519;  full  results  reported  in  [Table  7](#_page20_x37.61_y51.56);  forest  plots  reported  in Supplement 4). Cross-study heterogeneity was significant for all meta- analyses, and publication bias was not detected.

2. *Narrative synthesis on the effects of guanfacine on cardiovascular functioning.* Three  studies  assessed  cardiovascular functioning  in  chil- dren and/or adolescents with ADHD following treatment with guanfa - cine extended release (GXR) ([Boellner et al., 2007; Iwanami et al., 2020; ](#_page26_x37.61_y221.15)[Martin  et  al.,  2014)](#_page27_x306.60_y149.42)  and  were  included  in  the  narrative  synthesis. [Boellner et al. (2007) did](#_page26_x37.61_y221.15) not find any clinically significant changes in ECGs and vital signs throughout the study, although whether there was a statistically significant  increase  in  these  measures  post-treatment was not reported in the article. [Martin et al. (2014) found](#_page27_x306.60_y149.42) the mean SBP and DBP to be higher than baseline after 5 days of tapering GXR suggesting 

   that it is important to look at possible withdrawal effects of GXR. Iwa-

   [nami et al. (2020) ](#_page27_x37.61_y547.93)measured the long-term cardiac safety profile of GXR 

   and found no clinically significant changes in pulse rate or blood pres- sure indices following up to 60 weeks of treatment with GXR. 

3. *Summary  of  non-stimulant  findings.* Our  meta-analyses overall found  evidence  of non-stimulant medications not  affecting  cardiovas - cular measures, and findings from the narrative synthesis are in line with 

   this  conclusion.  However,  there  is  some  evidence  (from  the  meta- analysis)  that  ATX  may  be  associated  with  an  increase  in  SBP, compared  to  placebo.  In  the  narrative synthesis,  a  reduction  in  para - sympathetic  activity,  as  reflected  in  HRV,  was  also  found  following treatment with ATX. 

6. *Comparison of stimulant vs non-stimulant medications on cardiovascular functioning* 

Nine studies reported  cardiovascular functioning prior to and after 

the  administration  of  stimulant  and/or  non-stimulant  medications  in children and adolescents with ADHD and were included in the narrative synthesis ([Table 8),](#_page21_x37.61_y51.56) since effect  sizes could not be computed for these studies. 

1. *Narrative synthesis on the effects of ATX vs MPH on cardiovascular functioning* 

Five studies compared the effects of ATX relative, or in addition to, 

MPH on indices of heart rate ([Arcieri et al. (2012); Garg](#_page25_x306.60_y678.94)[ et al. (2014), ](#_page27_x37.61_y237.10)[Sangal  et  al.

(2014) found](#_page27_x37.61_y237.10) a significant  increase  in  heart  rate  in  the  ATX group  post-treatment whereas  no  significant  changes  in  heart  rate  from  baseline  to post-treatment were evident in the MPH group. Similarly, [Hammerness ](#_page27_x37.61_y412.44)

[et al. (2009) ](#_page27_x37.61_y412.44)found significant increases in heart rate with ATX mono - therapy, however, this did not increase with the addition of OROS MPH. Although  [Hammerness  et  al.  (2009) ](#_page27_x37.61_y412.44) did  not  find  any  evidence  of increased heart rate following adjunct OROS-MPH and ATX treatment, 

they  did  find  an  increase  in  arousal  related  side  effects  including insomnia  and  loss  of  appetite  in  the  adjunct  and  MPH  monotherapy groups  when  compared  to  ATX monotherapy. One  study  found  heart rate was  slightly  increased in both the MPH and  ATX groups, but this

was not statistically significant ([Snircova et al., 2017). ](#_page28_x37.61_y396.50)

When comparing long-term cardiovascular safety profiles of ADHD medications, one study reported an increase in heart rate following 6- and 12-months of treatment with either MPH or ATX in children/ado - lescents with ADHD ([Arcieri et al., 2012). ](#_page25_x306.60_y678.94)After 24 months of treatment, participants taking  MPH displayed  a significant  decrease  in heart  rate whereas no significant heart rate changes were observed in those taking ATX. However, the generalisability of these findings is limited given the small  sample  of  participants  assessed  at  the  24-month  follow-up (N = 61, across groups). 

Blood  pressure  changes  were  also  measured  across  four  studies which compared ATX vs MPH ([Arcieri et al., 2012, 2006; Hammerness ](#_page25_x306.60_y678.94)

[et  al.,  2009).](#_page25_x306.60_y678.94)  Three  studies  revealed  no  changes  in  SBP  following treatment with  MPH or  ATX ([Arcieri  et  al.,  2012;  Sangal  et  al.,  2006; Hammerness  et  al.,  2009).](#_page25_x306.60_y678.94)  Although  blood  pressure  was  measured  in [Garg et al. (2014), ](#_page27_x37.61_y237.10)these findings were not reported in the article. There 

is some evidence of an increase in DBP following atomoxetine treatment ([Arcieri et al., 2012; Hammerness et al., 2009; ](#_page25_x306.60_y678.94)[Sangal, 2006) although](#_page28_x37.61_y197.24) this does not appear to be evident after 24 months of treatment (Arcieri[ et al., 2012).](#_page25_x306.60_y678.94) Moreover, the addition of MPH to ATX monotherapy has also shown to result in an additional significant increase in DBP (Ham- [merness et al., 2009). ](#_page27_x37.61_y412.44)

2. *Narrative synthesis on the effects of LDX vs ATX on cardiovascular functioning* 

   One study measured heart rate and blood pressure following 9-weeks of  treatment  with  either  LDX or  ATX ([Dittmann  et  al.,  2013).](#_page26_x306.60_y396.50)  At endpoint, both treatments were associated with mean increases in heart 

   rate, SBP and DBP. Although the safety profiles of both treatments were similar,  LDX was  associated with  significantly  faster,  and more  robust treatment response, in those with ADHD. 

3. *Narrative synthesis on the effects of GXR vs MPH or AMP on cardiovascular functioning* 

   Two  studies  assessed  the  safety  of  GXR as  an  adjunctive  to  psy- chostimulants  or  placebo  ([Wilens  et  al.,  2012;  Spencer  et  al.,  2009).](#_page28_x306.60_y468.23) 

   [Wilens et al. (2012) found](#_page28_x306.60_y468.23) evidence of small decreases in supine pulse, SBP and DBP in participants receiving GXR alongside a psychostimulant relative  to  those  receiving  placebo  plus  a  psychostimulant. Similarly, [Spencer et al. (2009) ](#_page28_x37.61_y452.29)found higher doses of GXR to be related to greater mean decreases in blood pressure indices and pulse rate. 

4. *Narrative synthesis on the effects of Clonidine vs MPH on cardiovascular functioning* 

   One study explored the safety and tolerability of clonidine, alone and in combination with MPH in children with ADHD ([Daviss et al., 2008). ](#_page26_x306.60_y268.98)Cardiac safety was measured via ECG before and after treatment. They 

   found  clonidine  monotherapy  to  be  associated  with  a  higher  rate  of bradycardia,  defined  as  heart  rate  *<* 60  beats  per  minute,  when compared to groups not taking clonidine (i.e., MPH and placebo groups). 

5. *Summary of studies combining stimulants and non-stimulants* Methylphenidate  was  the  most  common  stimulant  medication investigated in studies where the cardiac safety assessments of stimulant and  non-stimulant medications were  measured  in  people  with  ADHD. Most studies compared the safety profiles of ATX vs MPH with evidence 

   of increased  heart  rate  and  DBP following  treatment with  ATX when compared  to  MPH,  although  one  study  showed  that  these  differences were  not  apparent  after  24-months  of treatment. This  is in  line  with evidence of increased heart  rate in the  early phases  of treatment with ATX which stabilises over time. 

4. **Discussion** 
1. *Summary and interpretation of main findings* 

We conducted a systematic review of the literature to investigate the effects of ADHD medications on ANS functioning. Although there were heterogeneous  results  across  medication  types  and  measures  of  ANS functioning, we found some evidence of an upregulation effect of ADHD medications (especially stimulants) on indices of autonomic functioning 

in people with ADHD. We now discuss these findings, beginning with a

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 144 (2023) 104968*
1. *Discussion of EDA findings* 

It is proposed that hypo-functioning of the ANS characterises ADHD 

and  that  ADHD  medications  are  likely  to  ameliorate  or  normalise autonomic  dysregulation  in  this  neurodevelopmental  condition.  We found evidence in line with this hypothesis from studies measuring EDA, 

with  most  studies  indicating  that,  at  rest  and  during  cognitive  tasks, children and adolescents with ADHD are hypo-aroused (at baseline) and MPH  alters  autonomic  activity  by  increasing  arousal  levels  to  some extent.  Additionally,  MPH also  improved  cognitive  processing,  specif- ically inhibitory processing, supporting the notion that ADHD medica -

tions target brain regions involved in higher level cognitive functions. Similar  to  the  ways  in  which  MPH appears  to  upregulate arousal,  as indicated by the EDA findings, it also appears to have similar effects on cognitive  performance, potentially  by increasing  the  release  of neuro - transmitters in pre-frontal areas. 

2. *Discussion of pupillometry findings* 

Similar  to  EDA findings,  we  found  evidence  of an  upregulation of arousal, as reflected in larger task evoked pupil diameter in response to target stimuli, in people with ADHD following medication use. Changes 

in pupillary dynamics were not paralleled by better task performance, highlighting  the  importance  of  using  direct  measures  of  autonomic arousal, such as pupillometry, which may be more sensitive to changes 

in arousal levels during cognitive tasks relative to behavioural measures (like RTV) which are indirect, putative measures of arousal. 

3. *Discussion of heart rate and blood pressure findings* 

Administration  of  stimulant  medications  resulted  in  increases  in heart rate and blood pressure values, and this was not dependent on the type  of medication investigated, e.g.,  MPH, LDX or  MAS (as  emerged from the meta-analyses and the narrative review). We found that ATX was more likely to increase SBP (but not heart rate or DBP) compared to placebo, but this effect was not found for other non-stimulants. More- over,  the  studies  included  in  the  narrative  review  on  non-stimulants (fewer  than  studies  on  stimulants),  although  with  conflicting  results, seem to suggest that non-stimulants are less likely to produce effects on cardiovascular measures, compared to stimulants. 

A key finding  from the  meta-analysis was a significant moderating effect  of  treatment  duration  on  cardiovascular  measures  following stimulant  medication  use  (when  compared  to  placebo)  with  longer treatment duration resulting in reduced effects of stimulant medications 

on heart  rate, SBP and DBP. Similarly,  our narrative synthesis of non- stimulant  medications  revealed  initial  decreases  in  heart  rate  and blood  pressure  following  GXR in  the  early  stages  of  treatment  (i.e., during  initial  medication  titration)  which  tended  to  return  to  pre- treatment/baseline levels  with continued  treatment (i.e., dose mainte - nance) or following discontinuation. These findings are in line with the known  physiological  effects  of stimulant,  and  non-stimulant,  medica - tions in which there is an initial increase (or decrease often in the case of non-stimulants) in cardiac indices which stabilise or return to baseline 

levels  during  continued  treatment or  discontinuation. Although  these initial changes in cardiac indices are found to be modest in most cases, longitudinal studies are needed to verify the extent of stabilising effects, over  time  and  across  different  subgroups  of participants (e.g.,  people with co-occurring conditions like anxiety). 

4. *Discussion of HRV findings* 

Interestingly,  studies  examining  the  effects  of  stimulant  and  non- stimulant  medication on  HRV found  a similar  pattern  of results.  Spe- cifically,  studies  showed  that  people  with  ADHD  displayed  higher RMSSD and HF HRV pre-treatment, which reduced following MPH and ATX administration. While higher HRV has often been associated with 

better  cardiac  health and  self-regulation ability,  this is not  always the case. Pathological conditions can also result in higher HRV resulting in a 

risk  of mortality  (Shaffer  and  Ginsberg.,  2017).  As such,  high  HRV is ‘normal’ within a range. In the context of our findings, higher RMSSD 

and  HF at  baseline  may  reflect  atypical  or  suboptimal levels  of HRV which are ameliorated following medication use. Thus, treatment with MPH and ATX, although resulting in different physiological outcomes, similarly affect arousal regulation (i.e., by altering HRV) in people with ADHD  and  improve  the  balance  between  the  parasympathetic  and sympathetic branches of the ANS. In support of this interpretation, Kim 

et  al.  (2011)  found  the  decrease  in  HF HRV following  treatment was accompanied  by  significant  clinical  improvements  as  reflected  in decreased  inattention,  hyperactivity,  and  total  scores  on  the  Korean ADHD Rating  Scale  (K-ARS). Similarly,  [Dogra  et  al.  (2017) ](#_page26_x306.60_y436.35) found  de- creases in resting parasympathetic activity (as reflected in decreased HF HRV) related  to  reductions  in  ADHD severity  indicative  of  improve - ments  in  clinical  symptoms  in  response  to  changes  in  the  autonomic balance. 

It is important to note however, that of the studies measuring HRV        and  included  in this  review,  only  one  included  a neurotypical control group ([Negrao et al., 2011). ](#_page27_x306.60_y452.29)Future studies should carry out more robust 

study  designs, including  a neurotypical control  group, to enable  accu- rate  conclusions  on  whether  any  observed  changes  in  the  autonomic balance, because  of ADHD medication administration, return to levels found in neurotypicals. Additionally, most studies investigating HRV in response  to  ADHD medications  have  used  MPH.  Further  research  is needed  using  other  stimulants  (e.g.,  LDX) as  well  as  non-stimulants (GXR), to  elucidate  possible  differences  of  medication  type  on  these measures and ANS functioning more generally. 

2. *Discussion of the findings in relation to pathophysiology of ADHD* 

The relationship between arousal, ADHD symptomology and cogni-

tive processing has been related to the functioning of the LC-NA brain system.  Specifically,  people  with  ADHD, relative  to  controls,  exhibit chronic tonic NA release due to LC neurons firing at lower frequencies. Atypical LC-NA functioning may therefore lead to difficulties in cogni-

tive functions characteristic of ADHD, including sustained attention and inhibitory control ([Howells et al., 2012). The](#_page27_x37.61_y492.14) small size and deep loca-

tion of the LC in the brain makes imaging this brain region challenging, although  recent  advances  in  neuroimaging  have  improved  LC local- isation  (see  [Ma¨ki-Marttunen and  Espeseth, 2021  for](#_page27_x306.60_y125.51) a review).  Never- theless, the methodological challenges and scarcity of imaging studies investigating this brain region has led to the use of objective, peripheral indices  to  explore  the  LC-NA systems  involvement  in autonomic  func- tioning and cognition, e.g., pupil size ([Murphy et al., 2014). One](#_page27_x306.60_y380.56) study in 

our  review  investigated the  effects  of ADHD medications  on  pupillary indices  with  evidence  of  increased  pupil  responses  to  task-relevant stimuli  following  medication  use  ([Wainstein  et  al.,  2017).](#_page28_x306.60_y149.42)  This  in- dicates that people with ADHD exhibited a naturally hypo-aroused state, 

as reflected  in the  lower pupil  size,  prior  to  medication. Furthermore, individuals  displayed  increased  phasic  LC  activation  towards task-relevant  stimuli  after  taking  MPH  supporting  the  adaptive  gain theory  of  LC functioning.  Namely,  stimulant  medications  increased autonomic functioning and improved  cognitive functioning via the LC 

and bi-directional connections to frontal systems. As such, future studies should consider designing experimental studies where autonomic (e.g., pupillometry), neuroimaging (fMRI) and  behavioural measures  (RTV) 

are  collected  to  ensure  an  accurate  interpretation  of  results  and  to further understand the relationship between these measures. 

Understanding the  neural  underpinnings of arousal  regulation  and the  influence  of arousal  on  attention may  lead  to  the  development of alternative  non-pharmacological  treatments  for  ADHD.  Medications, whilst shown to be largely effective in improving symptoms associated 

with  ADHD ([Faraone  et  al.,  2021),](#_page26_x306.60_y691.40)  do  not  work  well  for  everyone.  A relatively  new  intervention,  termed  vagus  nerve  stimulation  (VNS), similar  to  ADHD medications,  focuses  on  altering  the  neurochemical imbalances observed in ADHD ([Zaehle and Krauel, 2021). Specifically,](#_page28_x306.60_y587.78) 

VNS involves electrically stimulating the vagus nerve using an electrode with  varying  frequency  and  duration  ([Wong  and  Zaman,  2019).](#_page28_x306.60_y539.96)  A 

similar,  but  less  invasive  neurostimulation method  termed  trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD and involves stimulation of the trigeminal nerve on 

the forehead. Interestingly, chronic VNS and TNS have both been shown to  be  associated  with  increases  in LC activity  ([Groves  et  al.,  2005;  De](#_page27_x37.61_y356.65) [Cicco et al., 2018). ](#_page27_x37.61_y356.65)Like stimulants and non-stimulants, VNS increases 

NA levels  within  the  prefrontal  cortex  ([Follesa  et  al.,  2007)](#_page27_x37.61_y181.30)  and  may have similar effects to medications in improving attentional processing, representing a new method for treating ADHD. Nevertheless, the safety, efficacy,  and  long-term  impact  of  neurostimulation  methods  for  the treatment of ADHD is yet to be established. Furthermore, the relation -

ship  between  VNS/TNS  and  arousal  is unclear.  Well-designed  studies using  VNS/TNS  in  people  with  ADHD and  neurotypical  controls  are needed to clarify the mechanisms of action of these techniques and to optimise  parameters  (i.e.,  duration,  frequency)  for  its  use  in  ADHD. Further research combining neurostimulation with autonomic indices of 

arousal  (e.g.,  pupillometry)  may  also  help  elucidate  the  relationship between these measures in people with ADHD. 

3. *Methodological heterogeneity of studies* 

There are clear methodological issues in some studies with regards to the  inclusion  of  participants  with  co-occurring  symptoms/conditions. Given  that  co-occurring  conditions  such  as  conduct  disorder,  opposi - tional  defiant  disorder  and  autism  spectrum  disorder  are  common  in ADHD, it is important to consider the impact of these additional symp-

tom  profiles  on  autonomic  functioning.  Most  studies  included  in  this review  had  excluded  participants with  co-occurring  psychopathology, yet  of the  studies  which  included  such  participants, there  was  no  in- formation provided on how these symptoms/conditions were controlled 

for. Further research should consider the possible interaction between ADHD,  co-occurring  symptoms,  ANS  functioning  and  medication response to be able to generalise results to the real-world clinical pop- ulation.  Knowledge  of  the  interaction  between  these  factors  may  be useful to stratify participants into subgroups who display similar auto -

nomic profiles and who may benefit more so from one medication over another. Furthermore, it may be useful to consider other subgroups of participants, outside of co-occurring conditions, to identify participants who may be more affected by autonomic related side effects associated with ADHD medications. For instance, people with different metabolic statuses may be differentially affected by certain drug formulations. The plasma  half-life of ATX is approximately 5 hours in extensive  metabo - lisers relative to approximately 22 hours in poor metabolisers (Michel[ -](#_page27_x306.60_y284.92)

[son  et  al.,  2007).](#_page27_x306.60_y284.92)  As such,  if  there  is  already  a  clinically  significant impact of ATX on cardiac measures, this may be exacerbated and reflect 

a safety concern in poor metabolisers who experience greater accumu -

lation  of  this  drug  in  their  system  over  time.  Future  research  should consider  exploring  the  long-term  effects  of  ATX on  autonomic  func- tioning across people with different metabolic statuses to understand the impact  of this  medication on  subgroups  of patients  with  ADHD. Such studies could verify the interaction between genotype metabolic status, medication response and autonomic functioning in ADHD. 

Another methodological issue relates to the methods used to obtain blood  pressure  measurements. The  methods  used  differ  across  studies with  some  studies  using  automated  devices,  others  using  a  manual method with most studies not reporting the method used. It is important 

for future studies to standardise a method of measuring blood pressure as there  is evidence  suggesting  that  automated devices  tend  to  report blood pressure values higher than the auscultatory method (Park et[ al., ](#_page27_x306.60_y627.63)

[2005).](#_page27_x306.60_y627.63) Therefore, any supposed treatment emergent elevations in blood pressure  values  using  the  automated  device  would  be  difficult  to compare with the auscultatory method. Similarly, heart rate and heart 

rate  variability  were  measured  differently  across  studies.  Contextual factors, including recording period length, need to be considered before reliable  inferences  can  be  drawn  from  the  literature.  For  instance, recording period length strongly influences both time-domain values of 

HRV, like RMSSD, as well as frequency domain values of HRV such as HF power, with shorter epochs of measurement (i.e., 5 minutes) having less prognostic  power to detect morbidity relative  to longer (i.e., 24-hour) measurements (Shaffer  and  Ginsberg.,  2017).  It is particularly vital to optimise  the  measurement of arousal  indices  and  to  standardise these measurements across  studies  to  clarify  the  significance  or  clinical  im- plications of any elevations or reductions in cardiac function in response 

to pharmacological interventions. 

Additionally,  most  studies  included  in  this  review,  irrespective  of which  arousal  measure  was  assessed,  focused  on  MPH (stimulant) or ATX (non-stimulant) with a lack of representation of other medications. 

It is important for  future  studies  to  explore  the  impact  of other  medi- cation formulations on autonomic functioning given that many people 

who take these medications are non-responders to more common ADHD medications, like MPH, and may reflect a more heterogeneous sample of participants. For instance, studies using non-stimulant medications like clonidine would be useful to verify the effects of this type of medication 

on autonomic arousal, given that clonidine inhibits LC activity and de- creases  NA release. Similarly,  guanfacine has been found to be partic - ularly effective at improving  cognitive functioning in ADHD ([Arnsten, 2010)](#_page26_x37.61_y53.78)  and  for  individuals  who  cannot  tolerate  stimulant  medications due  to  the  exacerbation  of  comorbid  symptoms/conditions  (i.e.,  tic disorder), guanfacine has certain advantages in that it can often reduce, 

rather  than  increase  these  symptoms  when  compared  to  stimulant medication  ([Scahill  et  al.,  2001).](#_page28_x37.61_y284.92)  This  is  important  given  the  high occurrence of comorbid conditions in ADHD. For clinicians, it would be useful  to  understand  the  ways  in  which  stimulant  and  non-stimulant medications  affect  autonomic  functioning  when  used  as  mono - therapies  and  when used as adjuncts. Exploring  the influence  of these medications alone and in combination with one another may be one way 

to  delineate  how  the  underlying  mechanism  of actions  of these  medi- cations influence ANS activity and the impact this may have on cognitive processing. 

4. *Clinical implications* 

Accurately measuring autonomic arousal in people with ADHD may 

have  several  clinical  implications.  Based  on  the  evidence  that  has emerged from our review, HRV has been shown to be a reliable index of 

vagal tone and there is consistent evidence from this review which in- dicates  that  medication,  specifically  MPH,  results  in  a  reduction  of specific HRV parameters, including HF and RMSSD. As such, HRV may become  an  objective  measure  that  clinicians  could  use  to  monitor  the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for ADHD (in addition to 

self- and parent-reports), and that could prove especially useful for pa- tients  who  show,  at  baseline,  signs  of  autonomic  dysfunction,  e.g., parasympathetic dominance. For example, autonomic measures may be 

used to remotely monitor treatment progress and side effects. Wearable technology, like Fitbit, may be used to continually measure heart rate 

and to examine changes in these measures following treatment. Other forms of arousal, such as sleep patterns, can also be extracted using these devices  to  identify  the  direction  of  autonomic dysregulation in  those with ADHD and possible co-occurring conditions. Longitudinal studies 

such  as  the  Adolescent  Brain  Cognitive  Development  (ABCD) Study, where over 11,000 children are followed from ages 9–10 over a 10-year period, may offer one way to investigate these measures over time. This will  further  support  clinicians  in  tailoring  a suitable  treatment with  a better  prediction  of  treatment  outcomes  and  prognosis.  For  instance, people  with  a  baseline  level  of  arousal  in  the  form  of  sympathetic dominance,  as  established  from  arousal  indices,  may  benefit  from medications which aim to restore autonomic balance by reducing SNS activity relative to PNS activity. 

Moreover,  there  is an  increasing  need  to  develop  standardised in- struments to assess autonomic functioning and dysfunction (e.g., based on  normative  values  collected  in  the  neurotypical  population)  in different  situations  of everyday  life.  Understanding in  what  situations 

patients with ADHD struggle the most (e.g., in terms of self-regulation and  dysregulated arousal)  and  what  strategies they  naturally adopt  to achieve optimal arousal in those situations may support the clinicians in planning more personalised interventions. Similarly, in order to better disentangle the effects of medication in different contexts, it would be important  to  measure  autonomic  functioning  both  during  cognitive tasks and activities, as well as at rest. 

Additionally,  many  studies  showed  statistically  significant  differ- ences  in  autonomic  measures  following  medication use,  although  this was not always of clinical importance. For instance, increased pulse rate 

and  DBP following  MPH  and  ADL in  Findling  et  al.’s  (2001)  study, although statistically significant, was deemed clinically insignificant by 

the  authors.  This  is  because  small  increases  in  these  cardiovascular measures  would  not  result  in  a  discontinuation of this  medication in clinical  practice.  However,  statistically  significant  results  can  still  be scientifically  useful  information for  researchers aiming  to  understand autonomic  functioning  in  ADHD. As such,  statistical  and  clinical  sig- nificance  should  both  be  considered  when  interpreting  results  from studies in which the effectiveness of treatments is investigated. This will ensure a more accurate interpretation of findings statistically, as well as understanding the implications of these findings within clinical practice. 

5. *Limitations and future directions* 

This  review  offers  some  important  factors  for  future  studies  to consider  when  examining  the  impact  of  ADHD medications  on  auto - nomic  functioning.  However,  there  are  some  limitations  to  address. Firstly, given the lack of appropriate methodology, we were unable to 

carry out a meta-analysis for the EDA/pupil papers. This is likely to be a result  of  a  bias  in  our  inclusion  criteria,  specifically  the  inclusion  of studies  which  used  a  diagnostic  criterion  (ICD or  DSM) to  diagnose participants. As most EDA studies identified from the search were older (1970–1980 s)  and  specific  diagnostic  criteria  were  not  used  (or mentioned), this  prevented  us  from  including  these  studies  in  our  re- view.  Whilst  this  ensures  greater  reliability  in  the  interpretation  of findings, the excluded studies may have provided valuable information 

to clarify the relationship between ADHD, medication response and ANS functioning,  particularly  given  the  already  scarce  number  of  studies using these measures. Additionally, the EDA (and pupillometry) articles 

we  retrieved  were  limited  to  investigating  one  specific  medication (MPH,  a stimulant), children  and/or adolescents  (but  not  adults)  and one  acute,  short-term  follow-up  timepoint.  Most  studies  measured within-subject  effects,  on  and  off  medication,  and  did  not  include  a placebo condition, although recent studies have addressed some of these limitations ([Morris et al., 2022). It](#_page27_x306.60_y348.68) is vital that researchers use objective measures  of  arousal,  like  EDA and  pupillometry  more  frequently  in ADHD research to expand our understanding of autonomic functioning 

in this heterogeneous condition. 

Secondly, and most importantly, it must be noted that most studies included  in  this  review  were  not  specifically  designed  to  examine  the impact  of  medication  use  on  cardiovascular  functioning  per  se,  but rather  the  safety  and  efficacy  of these  medications. In this  way,  heart rate  and  blood  pressure  indices  were  measured  at  rest  and  therefore reflect baseline arousal levels which may bias the results. Investigating 

heart rate indices in response to a cognitive task may be useful to further explore changes in arousal levels across different contexts to clarify the relationship  between  medication  effects  and  autonomic  functioning. Furthermore, the methods used to measure cardiac measures were not detailed in many studies. Given that we did not exclude studies reporting cardiac indices as safety assessments, the results of this review may be influenced  by  these  methodological  choices.  Clinical  trials  are  often robust studies which provide useful information for researchers seeking 

to further understand medication effects within different clinical groups. As such, we recommend that the methods used to examine ANS activity 

are well-described in future clinical trials where cardiovascular indices are measured to enable an accurate analysis of any treatment emergent 

cardiac events. 

5. **Conclusions** 

   Overall, our study found evidence of important effects of stimulant 

and  non-stimulant  medications  on  autonomic  functioning  in  ADHD. Namely,  our  findings  support  previous  literature  which  suggests  that people with ADHD exhibit a hypo-aroused state as reflected in reduced activation  of the  sympathetic branch  of the  autonomic  system.  Medi- cations, specifically stimulants, and to a lesser degree, non-stimulants, 

appear  to  upregulate  a  general  hypo-aroused  state  often  observed  in people with ADHD as evidenced in studies measuring arousal via heart 

rate and electrodermal activity. Nevertheless, more rigorous research is needed to understand the effects of different ADHD medications on ANS functioning  and  to  investigate  whether  indices  of  autonomic  arousal could be used to predict or monitor the effects  of pharmacological in- terventions for ADHD on behaviour and cognitive functioning.
