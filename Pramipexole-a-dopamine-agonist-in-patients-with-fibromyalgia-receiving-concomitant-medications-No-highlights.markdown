A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Pramipexole, a Dopamine Agonist, in Patients With     Fibromyalgia Receiving Concomitant Medications

Andrew J. Holman and Robin R. Myers

***Objective.* To assess the efficacy and safety of pramipexole, a dopamine 3 receptor agonist, in patients with fibromyalgia.**

***Methods.* In this 14-week, single-center, double- blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, escalating- dose trial, 60 patients with fibromyalgia were random- ized 2:1 (pramipexole:placebo) to receive 4.5 mg of pramipexole or placebo orally every evening. The pri- mary outcome was improvement in the pain score (10-cm visual analog scale [VAS]) at 14 weeks. Second- ary outcome measures were the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), the Multidimensional Health As- sessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ), the pain improve- ment scale, the tender point score, the 17-question Hamilton Depression Inventory (HAM-d), and the Beck Anxiety Index (BAI). Patients with comorbidities and disability were not excluded. Stable dosages of concom- itant medications, including analgesics, were allowed.**

***Results.* Compared with the placebo group, pa- tients receiving pramipexole experienced gradual and more significant improvement in measures of pain, fatigue, function, and global status. At 14 weeks, the VAS pain score decreased 36% in the pramipexole arm and 9% in the placebo arm (treatment difference —1.77 cm). Forty-two percent of patients receiving prami- pexole and 14% of those receiving placebo achieved** >**50% decrease in pain. Secondary outcomes favoring pramipexole over placebo included the total FIQ score![](201onqsj.002.png)**

**(treatment difference —9.57) and the percentages of improvement in function (22% versus 0%), fatigue (29% versus 7%), and global (38% versus 3%) scores on the MDHAQ. Compared with baseline, some outcomes showed a better trend for pramipexole treatment than for placebo, but failed to reach statistical significance, including improvement in the tender point score (51% versus 36%) and decreases in the MDHAQ psychiatric score (37% versus 28%), the BAI score (39% versus 27%), and the HAM-d score (29% versus 9%). No end points showed a better trend for the placebo arm. The most common adverse events associated with pramipexole were transient anxiety and weight loss. No patient withdrew from the study because of inefficacy or an adverse event related to pramipexole.**

***Conclusion.*In a subset of patients with fibromy- algia,** **50% of whom required narcotic analgesia and/or were disabled, treatment with pramipexole improved scores on assessments of pain, fatigue, function, and global status, and was safe and well-tolerated.**

Abnormal autonomic arousal (1—4), altered sleep stage architecture (5), chronic pain, and fatigue charac- terize fibromyalgia syndrome. The pathogenesis of fibro- myalgia is a matter of debate, but centrally mediated abnormalities of sensory processing play an important role (6). Clinicians have tried various pharmacothera- pies, including such agents as antidepressants, antiepi- leptics, muscle relaxants, antiinflammatories, sedative hypnotics, analgesics, and nutriceuticals (7). As a central neurotransmitter, dopamine influences human behavior, autonomic arousal, and sleep (8). Discovery of dopa- mine receptor subtypes (D1—5) and their dopamine concentration—dependent presynaptic and postsynaptic effects has made analyses of these vital regulatory pathways more complex. These related receptors fulfill different roles in disparate locations, including D3 re- ceptors predominantly found in the mesolimbus (9,10).

Adrenergic arousal arising from the locus cer- uleus fragments normal sleep. Theoretically, this brain- stem stimulation may be negated, or at least modulated, by adaptive neurotransmission influenced by dopamine through D3 receptors in the mesolimbus. Dopaminergic neurotransmission reduces the expression of arousal from central sympathetic stimulation in the locus cer- uleus. Consequently, a D3 receptor agonist able to augment mesolimbic control of excessive adrenergic arousal could provide a new direction for the pharma- cotherapy of fibromyalgia.

Pramipexole (Mirapex; Boehringer Ingelheim, Ridgefield, CT) is a second-generation dopamine ago- nist that was developed for the treatment of Parkinson s disease. It is metabolized in the renal system and does not have significant effects on the cytochrome P450 system. Thus, interactions with other medications would not be expected. However, in Parkinson s disease, 14% of patients treated with pramipexole experience halluci- nations when it is used in combination with carbidopa, presumably due to enhanced D2 neurotransmission. It has 7—10 times greater affinity for the D3 receptor compared with the D2 receptor and 17 times greater affinity compared with the D4 receptor (10). It has no affinity for other dopamine receptors (D1 or D5) or for serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine, muscarinic, opioid,

1-adrenergic, or -adrenergic receptors. It has mild affinity for the 2-adrenoreceptor, a target of clonidine and tizanidine.

Blinded, placebo-controlled studies have demon- strated its efficacy in the treatment of Parkinson s dis- ease and restless legs syndrome (11). The cause of restless legs syndrome is unknown, but this arousal is more commonly found in patients with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls (12). Based on these observa- tions and the encouraging results of preliminary open- label studies of pramipexole treatment of fibromyalgia (13,14), we undertook the present study to evaluate pramipexole more rigorously in a randomized, placebo- controlled trial.

**PATIENTS AND METHODS**

**Entry criteria.** Patients who were eligible for this 14-week, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel-group, escalating-dose trial were ages 22—67 years and fulfilled the American College of Rheumatol- ogy (ACR) 1990 criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia (15). Inclusion criteria included patient-reported visual analog scale (VAS; 10-cm) scores for pain of 5 cm and tender point scores

` `10 (defined below). Exclusion criteria included uncontrolled thyroid disease, alcohol/substance abuse, pregnancy, lactation,

HOLMAN AND MYERS

untreated but documented sleep apnea, an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score 12, previous use of dopamine agonists, severe cervical pain on extension or known cervical myelopathy, and uncontrolled bipolar disorder, panic disorder, or psychosis as determined by the patient s psychiatrist.

To mimic a real-world setting, no specific medications were excluded, and a washout period was not required. Pa- tients receiving antiepileptic, antiinflammatory, antidepres- sant, hypnotic, and analgesic medications, including narcotics, were eligible for enrollment if the dosages had been stable for at least 6 weeks prior to study entry and were strictly main- tained throughout the duration of the study. Nonpharmaco- logic therapies, such as injection of trigger points, acupuncture, and massage, were allowed.

**Study design.** The protocol, telephone screening, and consent forms were approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB; Olympia, WA), and all patients pro- vided written informed consent at study entry. Patients were recruited by local advertisements and preliminary telephone screenings. Purchased pramipexole tablets were processed by Olympic Pharmacy (Gig Harbor, WA) and were supplied as capsules containing 0.25 mg, 0.50 mg, 0.75 mg, and 1.0 mg; calcium carbonate placebo capsules were identical. Using computer-generated codes, Olympic Pharmacy randomly as- signed packets to the placebo and active-treatment groups and maintained the security of the blind. Biweekly pill counts were performed at each study visit to monitor compliance.

Between August 2003 and February 2004, 60 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio of patients receiving active drug to patients receiving placebo for 14 weeks. The study medica- tion was taken daily at bedtime and was increased weekly, as follows: 0.25 mg at week 1, 0.5 mg at week 2, 0.75 mg at week 3, 1.0 mg at week 4, 1.25 mg at week 5, 1.5 mg at week 6, 1.75 mg at week 7, 2.0 mg at week 8, 2.5 mg at week 9, 3.0 mg at week 10, 3.75 mg at week 11, and 4.5 mg at weeks 12, 13, and 14. The dosage was then tapered to 0 mg during week 15. Evaluations were conducted every 2 weeks up to week 14, and the final evaluation was performed at week 15. At the discre- tion of the investigator, an additional 2 weeks could be allowed to slow the dosage escalation.

Safety assessments consisted of monitoring for adverse events at each study visit and by telephone. At each study visit, orthostatic supine and standing heart rate and blood pressure (after 30 seconds to increase sensitivity to orthostasis) as well as specific gravity of the urine were assessed. Serious adverse events were reported to the WIRB, Boehringer Ingelheim, and the Food and Drug Administration. Laboratory monitoring, including levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine, a complete blood cell count, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were obtained at study entry and visit 8 (when patients were taking 4.5 mg every evening). Dosages of all other medications were to remain stable, but if nausea occurred, addition of a proton-pump inhibitor was allowed. All subjects were given lansoprazole, pantoprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole, and then continued their preferred proton-pump inhibitor at their discretion. This strategy has been previously reported to improve pramipexole tolerability in patients with fibromyalgia (13,14).

Clinical assessments at each visit included the Fibro- myalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) (16), the Beck Anxiety

PRAMIPEXOLE TREATMENT OF FIBROMYALGIA

Index (BAI) (17), the 17-point Hamilton Depression Inventory (HAM-d) (18), the pain improvement scale, the tender point score, and the Multidimensional Health Assessment Question- naire (MDHAQ) (19). Assessments for restless legs syndrome activity were not performed. The pain improvement scale was

a self-assessment instrument to determine pain relief, and patients selected one of the following responses: none, a little, moderate, a lot, and complete relief of pain. The tender point score was defined as the sum of scores for the 18 fibromyalgia syndrome tender points, as defined by the ACR. Each tender point was scored on a scale of 0—3, where 0  painless, 0.5 trace tenderness, 1  classic tenderness ( 4 kg of pressure),

2  severe tenderness with grimacing, and 3 exquisite tenderness and sudden withdrawal (range 0—54). Both investi- gators standardized this tender point scoring technique to 10% variability prior to the beginning of the study, but the same assessor did not necessarily evaluate the same subject through- out the study.

Given the availability of pramipexole and the lack of industry and grant support for an open-label extension, pa- tients were independently unblinded by Olympic Pharmacy after they completed the study in order to facilitate their appropriate medical care with their other physicians. To limit bias, the entry criteria, protocol, and study design remained strictly rigid. The investigators interacting with the patients as well as all patients still enrolled in the study remained blinded until the conclusion of the entire study.

**Statistical analysis.** An intent-to-treat analysis was used for all outcome measures for patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 followup evaluation. The primary end point was defined as improve-

chi-square test, and safety data were evaluated by Fisher s exact test. Correlations were assessed by Pearson s correlation coefficient, if parametric, or by Kendall s tau, if nonparametric due to small data sets. In a secondary analysis, the influence of demographic data on outcome was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

**RESULTS**

**Characteristics of the study patients.** In response to newspaper advertisements, 204 patients contacted the investigators to inquire about the study and were screened by telephone. Sixty-eight of these patients were evaluated in the clinic, and 60 of them were entered into the study. Reasons for lack of participation were as follows: patient s decision (33%), Epworth Sleepiness Scale score 12 (23%), cervical spine myelopathy symp- toms (17%), VAS score for pain 5 cm (11%), previous use of dopamine agonists (10%), excessive travel dis- tance (9%), age (6%), uncontrolled psychiatric disease (2%), lack of fibromyalgia diagnosis (2%), heavy alcohol use (1%), and uncontrolled thyroid disease (1%) (Fig- ure 1).

Baseline characteristics of the study patients are summarized (Table 1). Three men and 57 women were enrolled into the study. Their mean age was 49 years (range 22—67 years), their self-reported mean duration of fibromyalgia syndrome was 8.6 years (range 1—50 years), and they had taken a mean of 9.6 medications for fibromyalgia syndrome (range 1—40), which were pre- scribed by a mean of 5.8 medical professionals (range 1—30). Preexisting renal disease and orthostasis were not exclusion criteria, but none of the subjects had either disorder at study entry. A greater percentage of patients

in the placebo arm used narcotic analgesics, but the treatment groups were well matched overall, and there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. A summary of concomitant medications taken by the study patients is shown in Table 2.

Of the 39 patients randomized to receive prami- pexole, 33 (85%) completed the study. One withdrew immediately after the entry visit because of lack of interest and an impending job transfer. Of the 21 patients randomized to receive placebo, 16 (76%) com- pleted the study. One withdrew at week 3 for the new occurrence of reactive arthritis, 1 moved to Central America at week 10, and 1 died at week 10 of unrelated medical issues. Protocol violations for initiating a new medication occurred in 2 patients in the placebo arm and 5 in the active arm; medications begun were citalo- pram (week 3; pramipexole), tramadol (week 5; prami- pexole), methadone (week 5; pramipexole), gabapentin

(week 7; placebo), valproate (week 7; pramipexole), diazepam (week 9; pramipexole), and zalepion (week 12; placebo).

Given the potentially beneficial effects of these new medications, efficacy assessments were made using only data obtained prior to the violation, but the patients continued in the study to monitor safety. No one with- drew because of inefficacy or a pramipexole-related adverse event.

**Efficacy.** The pramipexole group noted signifi- cantly decreased pain compared with the placebo group

at study end (week 14; 4.5 mg), as determined by scores on the VAS (Figure 2). The mean  SEM decrease in the VAS score for pain from baseline to the study end point was —2.48  0.38 cm (36%) in the pramipexole group and —0.71  0.54 cm (9.4%) in the placebo group, with a between-group difference of —1.77 cm (95% confidence interval [95% CI] —3.07, —0.47) (*P*  0.008) (Table 3). Significant improvement was also noted at week 12 (dosage of 4.5 mg) (*P*  0.03) and at week 15 following the 1-week taper, with a difference of —2.36 cm (95% CI —3.79, —0.86) (*P*  0.003). Except at week 3, all other VAS assessments for pain trended better for the

pramipexole arm without achieving statistical signifi- cance. Post hoc analysis of VAS scores for pain demon- strated that 82% of the patients taking pramipexole noted some improvement compared with 57% of those taking placebo (*P*  0.04). A 50% decrease in pain was achieved by 42% of those taking pramipexole compared with 14% of those taking placebo (*P*  0.03)

Secondary measures of efficacy favoring pramipexole over placebo included the FIQ score (Fig- ure 2), pain improvement scale (Figure 3), and the MDHAQ function, VAS fatigue, and VAS global scores (Table 3). At week 14 (dosage of 4.5 mg), the total FIQ score decreased by a mean SEM of —13.30  2.75 (24%) in the pramipexole group and —3.73  2.79 (7%) in the placebo group, with a between group difference of —9.57 (95% CI —18.01, —1.05) (*P*  0.028). Following the taper at week 15, the between-group difference was —14.1 (95% CI —23.0, —5.17) (*P*  0.003). The FIQ scores

also improved significantly at week 8 (dosage of 2.0 mg; *P*  0.047) and week 12 (dosage of 4.5 mg; *P*  0.047). Positive trends for the HAM-d total score, the BAI total score, the tender point score, and the MDHAQ psychi- atric score were evident, but they did not reach statistical significance. Subjects with abnormal HAM-d and BAI scores at study entry did not demonstrate a more substantial trend toward improvement with pramipex- ole.

ANCOVA revealed that all demographic vari- ables and concomitant medication categories, including narcotic use (F  0.002, *P*  0.96), education level (F 0.094, *P*  0.76), or disability status (F  0.32, *P*  0.57), did not significantly influence the VAS pain score out- come or the occurrence of adverse events.

**Safety.** Of the 59 patients who had at least 1 dose of study medication, 100% of them experienced at least

1 adverse event (Table 4). Most statistically significant adverse events included weight loss (mean —3.3 lbs; range of changes in weight —24 to 15 lbs) and increased anxiety in the pramipexole group and weight gain (mean 4.7 lbs; range of changes in weight —7 to 19) in the placebo group. Pramipexole was well tolerated, although nausea was very common in both treatment groups. Response to the voluntary addition of proton-pump inhibitors to treat the nausea was similar for both groups (62% in the placebo group versus 71% in the pramipexole group), and the proton-pump inhibitor response and patient preference were not predictable, as previously described (14). Patient preferences in the placebo group versus the pramipexole group for lanso- prazole 30—90 mg (15% versus 20%), pantoprazole 40—120 mg (39% versus 23%), esomeprazole 40—120 mg (31% versus 31%), and rabeprazole 20—60 mg (15%

  versus 26%), respectively, were not statistically signifi- cantly different. For 1 patient in the study, the dosage escalation was delayed for 1 week because of nausea (pramipexole group). In contrast to the treatment of Parkinson s disease with pramipexole, hallucinations and sleep attacks were noticeably absent in our study patients. Infections were common, but were equally distributed between the 2 study groups.

  Results of tests for hematopoietic, hepatic, renal, and thyroid function and inflammation were uniformly normal at study entry and at the final evaluation. Orthostatic hypotension, defined as a decrease in sys- tolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg combined with an increase in heart rate of 20 beats per minute, as assessed in both the supine and the standing positions, was not found at any visit.

  The incidence of serious adverse events was 2.6% in the pramipexole group and 4.7% in the placebo group. One patient died during the study; the cause of death was unclear but was thought to be unrelated to participation in the placebo arm of the study. One serious adverse event occurred in the pramipexole group. A patient was hospitalized because of transient global amnesia that lasted 24 hours. Despite a detailed

  evaluation, the cause remained obscure and did not recur. Investigators were informed of these events 1 week after the adverse event had resolved, and the patient elected to continue study participation. The study drug was continued (double-blinded), and the patient successfully completed the study 6 weeks later.

**DISCUSSION**

In this randomized, double-blind trial, pramipex- ole demonstrated greater efficacy compared with pla- cebo on measures of pain, function, fatigue, and global status after a 14-week, fixed escalation of the dosage to 4.5 mg taken at bedtime. This is the first trial of pramipexole and only the second trial for a D3 receptor agonist in the treatment of fibromyalgia (20). Pramipexole was generally well tolerated. These patients did not have the sleep attacks or hallucinations commonly described by patients taking pramipexole at a dosage of up to 1.5 mg orally 3 times a day for the treatment of Parkinson s disease. Orthostatic hypoten- sion was not seen at any treatment visits. About 40% of patients in the pramipexole arm lost 1—24 pounds over 14 weeks. During the study, weight loss was unpredict- able and random among the subjects, with wide variabil- ity. Consequently, significant weight fluctuations were not noticed by the investigators or typically noted by the patients. A mean loss of 3.3 lbs of weight in the pramipexole group over 14 weeks was interesting, but was too small to affect the double-blinded study design. Mild weight gain was more common in the placebo arm. Patients did not appear to lose weight because fibromyalgia symptoms improved. Weight loss in our study patients did not correlate with pain response or improvement in fatigue, function, or HAM-d scores. The impact of D2 receptor inhibition on weight gain in patients taking antipsychotic medications has suggested a role for a dopaminergic influence on the metabolic rate (21), but the role of D3 is unknown.

In both arms of the study, reports of nausea were remarkably common. An emphasis of the language in the consent form on the potential for nausea and discussions of proton-pump inhibitor dosing to control the nausea may have influenced the incidence of this adverse event. It is possible that some subjects may have erroneously suspected that they were receiving the active drug if they developed nausea. While nausea and med- ication intolerance are common for patients with fibro- myalgia, it is unclear whether this may have affected the placebo response during the study.

Increased anxiety was noted by 18 of 38 subjects

who took pramipexole and by none who took placebo (*P*  0.04). In contrast, the change in BAI scores from baseline reflected only a modest improvement in the pramipexole group as compared with the placebo group (*P*  0.31) (between group difference —2.62 [95% CI —7.73, 2.53]). This may be explained by the fact that cumulative adverse event reporting describes transient episodes of anxiety that are possibly related to a para- doxical stimulatory event rather than chronic anxiety. Interestingly, anxiety was usually reported early in the pramipexole dosage titration ( 2.0 mg every evening),

as has previously been described (13).

Most trials do not report outcome measures after discontinuation of an investigational medication. We chose to report these data to further explore safety and

to measure rebound symptoms of fibromyalgia. The VAS scores for pain and the FIQ scores decreased further at the conclusion of the 7-day taper period. Scores in the placebo group did not change. This study was not designed to address this finding or record additional data, but the finding raises interesting ques- tions about a mechanism of action of pramipexole in patients with fibromyalgia.

Dopaminergic neurons in the mesolimbus de- crease tonic pain in animal models (22). Dopamine and D2 agonists can decrease *N*-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)— mediated pain through activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase (23). Yunus (24) has proposed that dopamine agonists act as analgesics, but they may also play a more complex role, possibly a central autonomic regulatory role. Its relatively short serum half-life (8 hours) and efficacy when taken at bedtime would not favor a purely analgesic explanation for the effects of pramipexole. A dynamic neuroregulatory role deserves further study.

Although the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia is unclear, Wood (25) has suggested a central role for dopamine and the hippocampus, which mitigates mem- ory, learning, stress modulation, and nociception. The hippocampus also inhibits adrenergic arousal arising from the locus ceruleus (26). Chronic pain states alter hypothalamic—pituitary—adrenal axis activity and induce hippocampal atrophy (27). Consequently, modulation of adrenergic arousal could be impaired.

Inappropriate arousal of the sympathetic nervous system has also been demonstrated in fibromyalgia syndrome (28). But, autonomic tone depends on homeo- static balance. Inhibitory dopaminergic neurotransmis- sion in the hippocampus counteracts stimulatory arousal from the locus ceruleus. Excessive arousal or inadequate mesolimbic attenuation of adrenergic arousal, or both, could fragment sleep stage architecture in patients with

fibromyalgia. The specificity of pramipexole for the D3 receptor favors a hippocampal effect, because D3 recep- tors are found in the mesolimbic hippocampus and not in the locus ceruleus (29).

Dopamine-mediated D3 effects in the mesolim - bus are concentration-dependent, and a 4.5-mg dose of pramipexole every evening would be considered high compared with the lower doses typically used to treat restless legs syndrome or Parkinson s disease. High concentrations of pramipexole favor postsynaptic neuro- transmission (10). Lower concentrations favor a presyn- aptic effect that inhibits dopaminergic neurotransmis- sion in the hippocampus. Increased anxiety noted in patients taking pramipexole tended to occur very early in the dosage escalation. We hypothesize that lower pramipexole doses induced anxiety (adrenergic arousal) by initially enhancing presynaptic neurotransmission in the hippocampus. This action would favor an initial decrease in hippocampal activity and reduce its normal attenuation of adrenergic arousal. Gradually increasing the pramipexole dosage sufficiently enhances its postsynaptic effect. Consequently, this increasing postsynaptic dopaminergic neurotransmission would promote and augment hippocampal control of excessive adrenergic arousal. Future studies could quantify these proposed autonomic effects and their impact on sleep stage architecture with different dosages of pramipexole.

While autonomic dysregulation has been demon- strated in fibromyalgia, the role of autonomic imbalance in the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia remains unclear. Moldofsky and colleagues (5) induced fibromyalgia symptoms in normal subjects by using an auditory arousal to disrupt deep, non—rapid eye movement, stage 3/4 sleep for 4 consecutive nights. In a study of middle- aged women conducted in 1999, Lentz and colleagues (30) reproduced Moldofsky s findings; however, in a 1998 study, Older and colleagues (31) did not produce fibromyalgia symptoms despite effective reduction of stage 3/4 sleep. However, Older et al used a different arousal technique for fragmenting deep sleep stages. Their choice of music rather than a startling, computer- generated sound may indicate that the nature of the arousal matters as much as the actual disruption of sleep. Polysomnographic studies of pramipexole taken at bedtime in the dosages we used to treat fibromyalgia syndrome are needed to document whether its therapeu- tic effect occurs by abrogating the aberrant sympathetic arousal that fragments deep sleep.

These observations have led to the hypothesis that dysautonomic regulation drives the symptoms of many disorders commonly seen in patients with fibro-

myalgia (32), including irritable bowel syndrome, gastric hyperacidity, irritable bladder, anxiety disorders, palpi- tations, and temperature dysregulation. Fragmented sleep and loss of normal deep-sleep stages may simply be another consequence of prolonged dysautonomic arousal. It will require further study to determine whether fibromyalgia is the predictable sequela of ab- normal sleep or the resultant complex of inadequate stage 4 sleep combined with its dysautonomic protago- nist.

This study has a variety of limitations and unor- thodox design features. First, most fibromyalgia clinical trials do not allow concomitant medications. While data from previous trials may be more readily interpretable, patients who are willing to participate in such trials may not represent the norm. Although no medication has yet been approved specifically for the treatment of fibromy- algia, most patients have found some medications to be partially beneficial. Many are unwilling to discontinue their medications to participate in a typical clinical trial including these subjects. In clinical practice, caregivers often assess new medications as an augmentation strat- egy similar to this study design.

Our inclusion of patients taking stable dosages of other medications for fibromyalgia also increased the risk of Type II error. Monitoring patient commitment to stable dosages of medications was critical to assessing the treatment response. Initiating any potentially bene- ficial medication during the study could artificially affect the results of response analysis. Consequently, for pro- tocol violations, the response at the final, untainted, pramipexole dosage was used as the final response. This approach reduced this confounding variable, but it also decreased the final treatment response over baseline as compared with placebo.

This protocol may be more applicable to a subset of patients with partially treated or possibly more severe fibromyalgia. But, the study design limits the interpreta- tion of why or how pramipexole may improve pain, fatigue, and function scores. Also, while ANCOVA did not demonstrate a significant influence of demographic variables on treatment outcome, the study was not sufficiently powered to predict which combination of concomitant medications might yield a positive response to this adjunctive use of pramipexole. Longer trials are required to confirm these results, particularly in subjects who have discontinued concomitant medications.

The optimal rate of dosage escalation and the impact of other dosing schemes were not addressed in this study. However, the gradual increase in pramipexole dosage over many weeks appears central to the success

of the protocol. Other limitations include the 14-week duration of the study. These efficacy and safety results may not be generalizable to a longer duration of treat- ment. Since pharmacokinetic data are not available for treatment of humans with 4.5 mg of pramipexole each evening, accurate dopamine receptor dynamics and other potential pramipexole-related effects are un- known.

Finally, it should be noted that some exclusion criteria in this study were particularly important. Both positional cervical myelopathy (33) and untreated ob- structive sleep apnea (34) are potent adrenergic arousals that commonly contribute to autonomic dysregulation. Both conditions limit the efficacy and tolerability of a D3 agonist (13) when used to treat fibromyalgia. Given the significant prevalence of cervical pain and obstructive sleep apnea in patients with fibromyalgia, many may not respond to treatment with pramipexole. Although cervi- cal pain on extension may result from a variety of causes,

it was thought to be a reasonable query with which to exclude positional cervical myelopathy. Future studies may clarify why and how these two complex arousals influence sleep stage fragmentation, pain, fibromyalgia, and treatment response to a dopamine agonist.

In summary, a new treatment approach using a D3 receptor agonist offers hope to patients with fibro - myalgia. This 14-week study of pramipexole in patients with fibromyalgia demonstrated improvement in mea- sures of pain, fatigue, function, and global status, with a reassuring adverse event profile. Further investigation of this pramipexole treatment paradigm is warranted to determine its mechanism of action in patients with fibromyalgia, its long-term risks and benefits, and to confirm these findings in patients not taking concomi- tant medications.
