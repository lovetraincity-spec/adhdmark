**Abstract:** Pain, especially when chronic, is a common reason patients seek medical care and it affects the quality of life and well-being of the patients. Unfortunately, currently available therapies for chronic pain are often inadequate because the neurobiological basis of such pain is still not fully understood. Although dopamine has been known as a neurotransmitter to mediate reward and moti- vation, accumulating evidence has shown that dopamine systems in the brain are also involved in the central regulation of chronic pain. Most importantly, descending dopaminergic pathways play an important role in pain modulation. In this review, we discuss dopamine receptors, dopaminergic systems in the brain, and the role of descending dopaminergic pathways in the modulation of differ- ent types of pain.

1. **INTRODUCTION** 

Dopamine, discovered in 1958, is a monoamine neuro- transmitter in the brain [1]. It is well known for its role in cognition, pleasure, and reward-motivated memory [2, 3]. In recent  years,  an  increasing  number  of  studies  have  shown that  dopamine  homeostasis  in  the  central  nervous  system (such as spinal  cord, hypothalamus, and  anterior  cingulate cortex)  is  disrupted  by  nociceptive  stimuli  and  that  dopa- minergic pathways contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain or pain chronicity [4-6]. Dopamine is released from  the  terminals  of  dopaminergic  neurons  and  activates two types of receptors named D1-like and D2-like receptors. However, the two types of dopamine receptors are expressed differentially in different neurons, leading to different roles in pain modulation. In this review, we will discuss the differ- ent functions of dopamine receptors and the related pathways 

in terms of pain perception, development, and chronicity.

pathways in pain modulation were identified using the fol- lowing  keywords:  *descending  dopaminergic  pathways*  and *chronic pain*. Searches were limited to the papers that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. We summa- rize  79  papers  in  this  review.  The  papers  regarding  other descending pain modulation pathways (serotonin- and nore- pinephrine-mediated) have been excluded in the current re- view. 

3. **DOPAMINE RECEPTORS** 

Dopamine is derived from its precursor named  L-3, 4- dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), which is converted into dopamine  by  aromatic  amino  acid  decarboxylase.  As  a monoamine neurotransmitter, synthesis of dopamine is lim- ited by tyrosine hydroxylase [7]. Dopamine is stored in the vesicles  that  are  released  into  the  synaptic  cleft,  which  is controlled by phasic and tonic transmission. The dopaminer- gic neuron firing patterns correlate with different behaviors. Low  frequency  tonic  firing  in  dopaminergic  neurons  is mainly related to the selection of habitual motor programs independent of reward, while high frequency phasic bursts of action  potential  in  dopaminergic  neurons  are  related  to  a reward seeking movement [8]. 

Dopaminergic  neurons  mainly  originate  from  the  mid- brain, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra (SN), and hypothalamus [5]. Most dopaminergic neu- ron cell groups are derived from a single embryological cell group  that  originates  at  the  mesencephalic–diencephalic junction. The ventral side of the mesencephalon contributes

to 90% of the dopaminergic neurons. There are several do- paminergic  cell  groups  from  A8  to  A16  that  distribute  in different areas of the brain. Most of them are involved in the ascending pathways,  and a few of them are related  to de- scending pathways [9]. Dopamine receptors include D1-like and D2-like receptors. These dopamine receptors have dif- fering  pharmacological,  biochemical,  and  physiological functions. The D1-like receptor family includes D1 and D5 receptors,  while  the  D2-like  receptor  family  includes  D2, D3,  and  D4  receptors.  In  addition,  D1  and  D5  receptors share very high homology in their transmembrane domains, while  D2,  D3,  and  D4  receptors  are  closely  related  with 

highly conversed transmembrane sequences [10]. 

The  dopamine  receptors  distribute  differentially  in  the brain.  The  D1  receptor  mainly  distributes  in  the  striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc), olfactory tubercle, hypothalamus, and  thalamus.  In  contrast,  the  D5  receptor  is  mainly  ex- pressed in the hippocampus, the lateral mammillary nucleus, and parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus. Both D1 and D5 receptors are expressed in pyramidal neurons of the cortex, including the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. As far as the D2-like receptor family is concerned, the D2 receptor is mainly located in the core of NAc, striatum, and olfactory tubercle. The expression of D3 receptor in the brain is much less than that of D2 receptor [11]. In particular, the D3 receptor can form a heteromer with the D1 or D2 recep- tor  and  express  in  areas  associated  with  psychiatric  disor- ders, such  as NAc,  thalamus, hippocampus [12-14]. It has been shown that D4 receptors mainly locate in the prefrontal cortex,  hippocampus,  hypothalamus,  and  mesencephalon [10, 15]. 

Dopamine  receptors  differ  in  structure  and  pharmacol- ogy,  and  they  are  classified  into  different  metabotropic  G protein-coupled  receptors  (GPCRs)  subfamilies  with  seven transmembrane-spanning domains [16]. The GPCR receptors participate in synaptic transmission in brain neural circuits by activating the G protein to induce intracellular signaling. The  D1-like  dopamine  receptors  are  coupled  to  the  Gαs, which activates adenylate cyclase to produce a higher level of  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  (cAMP)  and  then  en- hances the activity of protein kinase A (PKA). In contrast, D2-like dopamine receptors are coupled to the Gαi/o, which inhibits  adenylate  cyclase  and  reduces  intracellular  cAMP concentration and then inhibits the activity of PKA [17]. In addition,  D1/D2  heteromers  and  D5  receptor  can  activate Gαq and trigger phospholipase C (PLC) downstream signal- ing pathways besides enhancing the PKA activity [18, 19]. Moreover, the D2 receptor can also activate the PLC path- way by binding Gβγ to increase calcium concentration and enhance the activity of  calcium/calmodulin-dependent pro-

tein kinase II [20]. 

Dopamine receptors and *N*-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors  can  interact  in  the  neostriatum.  Previous  studies have shown that the striatum D1 receptor facilitates and en- hances the activity of NMDA receptors, which is mediated by dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (32 kDa) [21-23].  The  C-terminal  tail  of  D1  receptor  can  cross-talk with NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B in the synaptosomal membrane fraction [21-23]. However, the interaction between the D2 receptor and  NMDA receptors 

remains unclear. Several studies showed that a D2 receptor agonist inhibits NMDA receptor excitability [24-26], while another study reported that the D2 receptor is not associated with NMDA receptors [27]. In addition, the interaction be- tween the dopamine receptors and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic  acid  (AMPA)  receptors  has also been demonstrated [28, 29]. In rodent studies, the ex- pression of D1 and D2 receptors in the contralateral NAc is down-regulated on day 28 of chronic neuropathic pain [30]. We recently reported that the D2 receptor plays a critical role in the descending inhibition of trigeminal neuropathic pain [31]. Therefore, the dopamine receptors could be indispensa- ble in regulating neuronal excitability. 

4. **DOPAMINE  PATHWAYS  AND  THEIR FUNCTIONS** 

   There are eight dopamine pathways in the brain. The four major pathways are: 1) The mesolimbic pathway from VTA to NAc; 2) The mesocortical pathway from VTA to prefron- tal  cortex;  3)  The  nigrostriatal  pathway  from  the  SN  pars compacta (SNc) to the caudate nucleus; and 4) The tuberoin- fundibular pathway from tuberal hypothalamus to pituitary gland  [32].  The  four  minor  pathways  are  from  VTA  to amygdala,  hippocampus,  cingulate  cortex,  and  olfactory bulb, respectively [16]. 

   Among  these  dopamine  pathways,  three  pathways  are involved  differentially  in  ascending  projections,  including mesolimbic,  mesocortical,  and  nigrostriatal  pathways  [9]. These ascending dopaminergic pathways are related to re- ward-cognition and motor function regulation [33, 34]. Be- sides these ascending projections, there are some dopamine cell groups that are involved in descending pathways. The A11 nucleus in the posterior hypothalamus is an important dopamine cell group that can project to both brainstem and spinal cord [4, 6].  This descending dopaminergic pathway plays  a  critical  role  in  locomotor  function  regulation  and pain modulation [6, 35-37]. For instance, the pathway from A11 nucleus to the spinal cord contributes to motor recovery after spinal cord injury [4, 35]. The descending dopaminer- gic projections from A11 nucleus to the spinal dorsal horn or spinal  trigeminal  nucleus  caudalis  (Sp5C)  are  involved  in descending pain modulation [4, 6]. It has been reported that the descending dopaminergic pathway can send direct inhibi-

   tory  projections  to  the  target  areas  [38].  For  instance,  the dopaminergic neurons in the hypothalamic A11 nucleus di- rectly project to the Sp5C and excitation of the descending dopaminergic  neurons  inhibits  orofacial  neuropathic  pain [31]. The A11 dopaminergic neurons also send direct inhibi- tory projections to the spinal dorsal horn, which may be the sole source of spinal dopamine [38]. 

5. **ROLE  OF  DESCENDING  DOPAMINERGIC PATHWAYS IN PAIN MODULATION** 

   In the descending dopaminergic pathways from A11 nu- cleus to Sp5C or spinal dorsal horn for pain modulation, D1- like  receptors  contribute  to  pain  development  and  mainte- nance, whereas D2-like receptors exert  an anti-nociception effect  [39].  It  has  been  reported  that  dopamine  receptors D1/D5 engage the mechanism of spinal hyperalgesic priming and  maintenance  of  pathological  pain  plasticity  and  that

   D1/D5 agonists induce mechanical hypersensitivity [4]. Our recently published work demonstrates that activation of do- paminergic neurons in the hypothalamic A11 nucleus attenu- ates peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, which is mediated by D2-like dopamine receptors [31]. Taylor and colleagues  found  that  microinjection  of  selective  D2-like dopamine  receptor  agonist  quinpirole  in  the  NAc  inhibits formalin-induced persistent nociception in the hind paw [40]. Taken together, these studies indicate that D1-like and D2- like dopamine receptors play opposite roles in pain modula- tion. In addition, another study reported that D2-like dopa- mine receptors are not involved in the decreased postopera- tive nociceptive threshold induced by plantar incision [41]. Therefore, the role of descending dopaminergic pathways in pain modulation is not only dependent on dopamine receptor types, but also related to pain models. In the clinic, patients with burning mouth syndrome showed a much higher num- ber of unoccupied D2 receptors  in the  left putamen  and a lower D1/D2 ratio in the bilateral putamen [5, 42]. The de- crease in the D1/D2 ratio suggests the decline of endogenous dopamine  in  the  putamen  of  patients  with  burning  mouth 

   syndrome. 

   Emotional pain is related to attention, anxiety, memory and expectations [43]. Previous studies have shown that do- pamine  homeostasis  determines  pleasure-seeking  or  pain- avoidance,  which  are  closely  associated  to  the  emotional component of pain [44, 45]. Phasic and tonic dopamine re- lease works together to maintain homeostasis of dopamine levels that regulates emotional component of pain [44, 45]. Phasic or transient dopamine release represents the depolari- zation of dopamine neurons and the dopamine release is ob- tained  by  opening  the  classic  voltage-dependent  calcium channel, which is due to behavioral stimuli, such as feeding [46]. The tonic mechanism is mediated by the activation of NMDA receptors at the terminals of dopaminergic neurons, which  results  in  calcium  influx  and  triggers  dopamine  re- lease.  Tonic  dopamine  release  is  to  maintain  extracellular dopamine  levels  for  dopamine  receptor  stimulation  [45]. However,  a  recent  study  reported  that  although  dopamine appears to affect expectations and desires, dopamine changes in  the  brain  do  not  affect  emotional  pain  in  patients  with chronic  neuropathic  pain  after  placebo  intervention  [47]. Using von Frey and conditioned place preference tests, we observed  that  activation  of  the  descending  dopaminergic pathway from hypothalamic A11 nucleus to Sp5C inhibits both sensory and emotional components of pain induced by peripheral nerve injury [31]. 

   Here, we summarize the role of descending dopaminergic pathways from hypothalamus, hippocampus, or NAc in pain modulation. 

1. **Hypothalamus** 

By using retrograde tracing, five hypothalamic areas are shown to project to the Sp5C, including the paraventricular nucleus, the lateral hypothalamic area, the perifornical hypo- thalamic area, the A11 nucleus, and the retrochiasmatic area [48].  This  suggests  that  the  hypothalamus  A11  nucleus,  a key dopaminergic cell group, may contribute to trigeminal pain modulation. Dopamine denervation of the A11 nucleus mediates  formalin-induced  trigeminal  pain  in  rats  [6]. 

***Li et al.*** 

Moreover,  serotoninergic  and  dopaminergic  descending pathways  that  project  to  the  trigeminocervical  complex (TCC) can interact with each other through dopamine D2- like receptors and serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptors. By using electrophysiological recordings, it has been shown that selec- tive  D2-like  receptor  agonist  (quinpirole)  and  5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist (naratriptan) induce a reversal of the facili- tation of nociceptive cell firing in the TCC. And after A11 lesion, the nociceptive cell firing in the TCC is inhibited by quinpirole and quinpirole plus naratriptan application [49], which  suggests  that  both  dopaminergic  and  serotonergic pathways can produce antinociceptive effects simultaneously through the activation of D2-like receptor and 5-HT1B/1D receptor, respectively. 

Abdallah and colleagues published two papers to demon- strate  that  the  descending  dopaminergic  pathway  from  the hypothalamus A11 nucleus to Sp5C contributes to formalin- induced orofacial pain in rats [6, 48]. The dopaminergic neu- rons in the A11 are also involved in the maintenance of me- chanical hypersensitivity in mice [4]. And the lesion of A11 dopaminergic neurons reverses the mechanical pain mainte- nance [4]. In spared nerve injury (SNI)-induced neuropathic pain,  activation of dopamine D2 receptors  in  the A11 nu- cleus  inhibits  neuropathic  hypersensitivity.  Using  D1-Cre and D2-Cre transgenic mice, we observed that both D1 and D2 receptors are expressed in the Sp5C and the two types of dopamine  receptors  mostly  distribute  in  different  neurons, suggesting that dopamine may exert different pain regulation by binding to different receptors. In a trigeminal neuropathic pain animal model, induced by chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve, we observed that optogenetic excita- tion  or  chemogenetic  activation  of  the  descending  dopa-

minergic pathway from the hypothalamic A11 to Sp5C alle- viates the neuropathic pain *via* activation of D2 receptors in the Sp5C [31]. Moreover, 6-OHDA-produced A11 lesion of dopaminergic neurons exacerbates such pain, suggesting that the  descending  A11-Sp5C  dopaminergic  pathway  is  pain- inhibitory [31]. 

Migraine  is  the  most  common  form  of  headache.  In clinic,  D5  dopamine  receptor  upregulation  is  observed  in some  patients  suffering  from  migraine,  suggesting  an  in- volvement of dopamine in the headache pathogenesis [50]. In addition, dopamine receptor antagonists have been used to treat migraine, and all neuroleptics used to block dopaminer- gic pathways are antagonists of dopamine D2 receptors [51, 52]. In animal experiments, Haarmann and colleagues found that dopamine D2 receptors can modulate the initiation of spreading depression related to migraine, suggesting that the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride may be used as a potential therapy for migraine pain [53]. In addition, a recent clinical study reported that migraine sufferers are showing a  close association with dopamine beta hydroxylase gene polymor- phisms [54]. The dopamine modulation of migraine has been summarized  in  a  review  article  published  in  2013  [55]. Moreover, the simultaneous influence of dopamine receptors and 5-HT1B/D receptors can produce migraine pain relief by inhibiting neuronal activities [49]. 

A  clinical  study  indicates  that  patients  with  migraines show  enhanced  hypothalamic  activation  by  positron  emis- sion tomography (PET) scans during and after migraine at-


tacks.  However,  the  exact  location  of  the  involved  hypo- thalamus is unclear due to resolution  issues [56]. A high- resolution 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan confirms the role of the hypothalamus in migraine at- tacks [57]. And this study shows that the acute pain phase is closely associated with the posterior part, while the episodes and development of migraine involve the anterior part of the hypothalamus  [57].  Analysis  and  summarization  of  fMRI image  processing  demonstrate  that  different  stages  of  mi- graine  attacks  involve  different  brain-oxygen-level- dependent changes in brain regions [58]. 

2. **Hippocampus** 

Shamsizadeh and colleagues found that dopamine recep- tors in the dorsal hippocampus (CA1) region are involved in orofacial pain induced by subcutaneous injection of formalin [59]. Using microinjection of D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptor antagonists or agonists into hippocampus CA1 area, they observed that D1-like receptor agonist SKF-38392 pro- duces  analgesic  effect  on  first  (early)  and  second  (late) phases of formalin-induced orofacial pain and that D2-like receptor agonist quinpirole also inhibits the orofacial pain in both phases [59]. Moreover, the antagonists of D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors reversed such analgesic effects produced  by  respective  dopamine  receptor  agonist  [59]. These results suggest that dopamine receptors in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region play an important role in formalin- induced orofacial pain. 

In a recently published review  article [60],  the authors discussed  the  important  role  of  hippocampus  in  migraine. And  the  relationship  between  hippocampus  and  migraine, including hippocampal structure and volume, migraine onset, frequency,  prognosis,  and  associated  allodynia,  has  been demonstrated by studies using fMRI [60]. Moreover, a clini- cal study examined the 3T scanned images from 61 migraine patients and 57 healthy people and showed that the severity of migraine is significantly correlated with the decrease of hippocampal volume on the left side [61]. The connectivity between the hippocampus and the limbic system is related to the severity of allodynia symptoms, but not the frequency of headache in migraine patients [61]. However, another study showed the right hippocampal volume, but not the left part, is related to migraine attacks by conducting MRI scans of 31 healthy  people  and  122  migraine  patients  [62].  And  this study also showed that migraine frequency is dependent on hippocampal volume changes [62]. Additionally, a research team from the Headache and MRI center in Italy, analyzed fMRI images, and their data indicate that the hippocampus plays a key role only in the first phase of a migraine attack [58]. Although clinical studies have shown a link between hippocampus  and  migraine,  it  is  unknown  how  dopamine  or dopamine receptors in the hippocampus are involved in migraine. 

3. **NAc** 

In a clinical study, altered grey matter in NAc was found in  patients  with  idiopathic  trigeminal  neuralgia  and  these patients have larger NAc volumes, suggesting NAc structure changes  may  contribute  to  ongoing  trigeminal  pain  [63]. Another study showed that NAc activity correlates with dif-

ferent  cortical  circuitry  in  patients  with  chronic  back  pain and thus the regulation of NAc activity may have analgesic effect [64]. The dopaminergic pathway in the NAc have been shown to contribute to inflammatory pain [40]. Microinjec- tion of quinpirole, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, into the NAc inhibits formalin-induced pain in the hind paw and pre- treatment with raclopride, a dopamine D2 receptor antago- nist, blocks this anti-nociceptive effect [40], suggesting that the  dopaminergic  activity  in  the  NAc  can  be  regulated  to treat pain. A recent study reported that the shell of NAc is involved in peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain [65]. And inhibition or activation of spiny projection neurons in the NAc can alter tactile allodynia status and this study suggests that the NAc may contribute to central pain proc- essing and ascending nociceptive transmission [65]. 

Dopamine in the NAc is critical for reward and motiva- tion,  including  the  reward  from  pain  relief,  thus  targeting reward/motivation circuits could be used for pain modulation [66, 67]. Dopaminergic neurons coding motivational valence are more common in the VTA that projects to the NAc shell; however,  dopaminergic  neurons  coding  motivational  sali- ence are more common in dorsolateral SN that projects to the NAc  core  [68].  Therefore,  the  dopaminergic  pathways  in different  NAc  areas  may  play  different  roles  in  re- ward/motivation-related  pain  processing.  In  a  spinal  nerve ligation-induced  neuropathic  pain  rat  model,  microdialysis analysis showed that pain relief caused by intrathecal injec- tion  of  pregabalin  increases  intra-NAc  dopamine  release during the early phase of the neuropathic pain (17˗20 days after ligation), but not in the late phase of the neuropathic pain (31˗34 days after ligation) [69]. In addition, the dopa- minergic neurons projecting from VTA to NAc participate in exercise-produced  pain  relief  in  a  spinal  nerve  ligation-

induced neuropathic pain model [70]. 

Painful  stimulation  can  regulate  dopamine  signaling  in different parts of NAc [71]. In anesthetized rats, induction and termination of tail pinch-induced pain trigger dopamine release  in  the  core  and  shell  of  NAc,  respectively,  which probably depends on the distribution of dopamine receptors in different parts of NAc [71]. In the direct pathway of NAc, dopamine enhances GABAergic direct spiny projection neu- rons by acting on the D1 receptor, which is associated with reward and positive emotions; in the indirect pathway, do- pamine acts on the D2 receptor and inhibits GABAergic in- direct spiny projection neurons [65, 72]. After spared nerve injury,  increased  excitability  of  NAc  GABAergic  indirect spiny  projection  neurons  worsens  tactile  allodynia  [65]. Moreover, during 7 to 12 days after chronic pain induction, the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) is decreased in D2-expressing neurons of the NAc, most likely attributing to the declined ratio of AMPA recep- tor-mediated  EPSCs  to  NMDA  receptor-mediated  EPSCs [73]. 

An animal study has shown that cortical spreading de- pression increases dopamine release in the NAc, but reduces dopamine release in the nucleus caudate [74], which is re- lated to the redistribution of oxygen supply in the subcortical regions [74]. In a clinical study using MRI and PET scans, changes in endogenous µ-opioid receptors were observed in the NAc of migraine patients [75]. Compared with healthy

controls,  migraineurs  showed  a  decrease  in  the  volume  of left  nucleus  caudate  and  right  NAc,  which  is  significantly associated with the duration of migraine attack [76]. And the lasting time of migraine burden depends on the connection of the right NAc and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex [76]. In  a  migraine-like  pain  animal  model  by  injection  of  in- flammatory mediators into the rat dura mater, migraine in- duction  elicits dopamine release  in  the NAc, and relief of migraine pain activates the dopaminergic reward pathway to cause negative reinforcement of behavior [77]. 

**CONCLUSION** 

The descending pain modulation is mainly mediated by monoaminergic pathways, including descending projections mediated  by  dopamine,  norepinephrine,  and  serotonin  [78, 79]. We focus on discussing descending dopaminergic path- ways in this review. By activating different types of recep- tors, the descending dopaminergic pathways can exert either facilitatory or inhibitory pain-modulating effects [4, 31]. The overall balance between pain facilitation and pain inhibition mediated  by  these  dopaminergic  pathways  contributes  to top-down pain modulation.
