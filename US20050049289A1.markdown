0001\. This application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 10/198,480 filed Jul. 18, 2002, which claims benefit under 

35 U.S.C. S 119(e) of prior provisional application Ser. No. 60/312,241, filed Aug. 14, 2001. 

FIELD OF THE INVENTION 

0002  The invention relates to the use of 2-amino-4,5,6, 7-tetrahydro-6-n-propylaminobenzothiazole, the (+) or (-) 

enantiomer thereof, the pharmacologically acceptable acid addition Salts thereof, as well as hydrates and Solvates, for 

preparing a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and/or treatment of ADHD. 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

0\.003  2-Amino-6-n-propylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroben 

Zothiazole is a dopamine agonist which is also known in the art by the name pramipexole. Pramipexole and processes for 

preparing it are known for example from EP-A-186 087 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,812. It is known in particular for the treatment of Schizophrenia and particularly for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The prior art further discloses, for example, that pramipexole lowers the prolactin Serum level (DE 38 43 227). 

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 

0004  Surprisingly, it has been found that pramipexole can be used in therapeutically effective doses for the pre vention and/or treatment of ADHD. 

0005  Accordingly, the present invention relates to the use of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-n-propylaminoben 

Zothiazole, optionally in the form of its (+) or (-) enanti omer, optionally in the form of the pharmacologically acceptable acid addition Salts, as well as hydrates and Solvates, for preparing a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and/or treatment of ADHD. 

0006\. The abbreviation ADHD stands for “attention defi cit hyperactivity disorder'. It denotes a disorder which affects both children and adults in the form of an attention deficit. ADHD also refers to a hyperactivity disorder which is also observed both in children and adults. Depending on which of the above disorders predominates, ADHD may be observed in different degrees. There is the combined type in which both an attention deficit and a hyperactivity disorder can be observed, the predominantly inattentive type and the predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type. 

0007\. The combined type is present when at least six out of nine Symptoms of the attention disorder and hyperactiv ity/impulsivity persist for at least six months. If at least Six symptoms of attention deficit but fewer than six of hyper activity/impulsivity have persisted for at least Six months it is the predominantly inattentive type. The predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type is present when at least Six symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity but fewer than six of attention deficit have persisted for a period of at least Six months. 

0008\. The following criteria of assessment are symptoms of inattentiveness and hyperactivity, which form the basis for classifying the abovementioned types of ADHD (accord 

ing to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychic Disorders, Version IV (DSM IV): 

\0009)  Inattentiveness 

0010  frequently takes no notice of details or makes 

errors of haste in Schoolwork, at work or in other activities, 

\0011) often has difficulty maintaining concentration for lengthy periods during tasks or when playing, 

0012  frequently appears not to be listening when 

spoken to by other people; 

0013  often does not filly carry out instructions from 

other people and cannot complete Schoolwork, other work or duties in the workplace; 

0014  frequently has problems organizing tasks and 

activities, 

0015  frequently avoids, is disinclined to do or often 

only undertakes under protest tasks which require Sustained mental effort; 

0016  frequently loses objects that he/she needs for 

tasks or activities, 

\0017) is often easily distracted by external Stimuli; 

\0018) is often forgetful during everyday activities, 0019  Hyperactivity 

0020  frequently fidgets with hands or feet or shifts 

around on the chair; 

0021  often stands up in class or in other situations 

where people are expected to stay Seated; 

0022  frequently runs around or climbs up exces 

Sively in situations where this is inappropriate (in young people or adults this may be restricted to a Subjective feeling of restlessness); 

0023  often has trouble playing quietly or occupying 

him/herself quietly with leisure activities; is often “on the go” or frequently acts as if he/she were “driven'; 

0024  often talks excessively; impulsiveness; 

0025  often bursts out with the answers before the 

question is finished; 

0026  has trouble waiting his/her turn; 

0\.027  often interrupts p  and disturbs other people peop (e.g., interrupts conversations or breaks into other people's games). 

0028\. Accordingly, the present invention relates to the use of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-n-propylaminoben 

Zothiazole, optionally in the form of the (+) or (-) enanti omer thereof, optionally in the form of the pharmacologi cally acceptable acid addition Salts thereof, as well as hydrates and Solvates, for preparing a pharmaceutical com position for the prevention and/or treatment of attention 

deficits. 

0029  Moreover, the present invention relates to the use of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-n-propylaminobenzothiaz 

ole, optionally in the form of the (+) or (-) enantiomer thereof, optionally in the form of the pharmacologically 

acceptable acid addition Salts thereof, as well as hydrates and Solvates, for preparing a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and/or treatment of hyperactivity disorders. 

0\.030. In another aspect the present invention relates to 

the use of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-n-propylaminoben Zothiazole, optionally in the form of the (+) or (-) enanti omer thereof, optionally in the form of the pharmacologi cally acceptable acid addition Salts thereof, as well as hydrates and Solvates, for preparing a pharmaceutical com position for the prevention and/or treatment of hyperactivity disorders accompanied by attention deficit. 

0\.031)  For treatment and/or prevention of the medical 

indications described above, in addition to monotherapy using pramipexole it is also possible, as an alternative, to carry out a combined therapy using pramipexole with one or more, preferably one other pharmaceutically active com pound. It may prove effective, for example, to use a com bination with active Substances Selected from among the C-Sympathomimetics and antidepressants, preferably tricy clic antidepressants, antidepressants of the SSRI, or antide pressants of the MAO type. 

0032\. In the case of a combined therapy, pramipexole may preferably be used to treat the abovementioned condi tions with one or more, preferably one of the following Substances: methylphenidate, amphetamine, amphetaminil, methamphetamine, pemoline, tomoxetin, desipramine, imi pramine, bupropion, and modafmil, of which methylpheni date, amphetamine, pemoline, tomoxetin, and modafinil are particularly preferred. 

0\.033  Pramipexole may be used within the scope of the 

present invention as a racemate or in the form of its (+) or (-) enantiomer. Moreover, pramipexole may be used in the form of the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition Salts thereof as well as optionally in the form of its hydrates and/or Solvates. By pharmaceutically acceptable acid addi tion Salts are meant according to the invention the Salts selected from the salts of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, Sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methaneSulfonic acid, acetic acid, fumaric acid, Succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, and maleic acid, of which the Salts of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, Sulfuric acid, phos phoric acid, and acetic acid are particularly preferred. The Salts of hydrochloric acid are particularly important. Most preferably, within the Scope of the present invention, there fore, the hydrochlorides of pramipexole are used, pramipex ole dihydrochloride being of particular Significance. Of the hydrates of pramipexole, pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate is particularly preferred. 

0034\.  The dosage of pramipexole naturally depends to a great extent on the clinical picture. For example, without restricting the present invention thereto, pramipexole may be used in doses of about 0.05 mg to 7.5 mg, preferably 0.1 mg to 5 mg per day. These doses are based on pramipexole in the form of its free base. Based on the salt form prami 

pexole dihydrochloride monohydrate which is preferably used, the doses mentioned above correspond to about 0.07 

mg to 10.65 mg, preferably 0.14 mg to 7.1 mg of prami pexole dihydrochloride monohydrate per day. 

0035\. One possible dosing method, which is to be under stood as being merely an illustrative example, is described below, based on pramipexole in the form of its free base: individual dosage titration at weekly intervals depending on activity and acceptability. 

0036) 1st week: 1 tablet containing 0.088 mg of 

pramipexole 3 times a day; 

0037  2nd week: 1 tablet containing 0.18 mg of 

pramipexole 3 times a day; and 

0038  3rd week and thereafter: % tablet containing 

0\.7 mg of pramipexole 3 times a day. 

0039\. Within the scope of the use according to the invention pramipexole may be administered orally, trans dermally, intrathecally, by inhalation or parenterally.
