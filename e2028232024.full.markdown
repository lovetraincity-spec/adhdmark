Exercise is known to bene  t motor skill learning in health and neurological disease. Evidence from brain stimulation, genotyping, and Parkinson s disease studies converge to suggest that the dopamine D2 receptor, and shifts in the cortical excitation and inhibition (E:I) balance, are prime candidates for the drivers of exercise-enhanced motor learning. However, causal evidence using experimental pharmacological challenge is lacking. We hypothesized that the modulatory effect of the dopamine D2 receptor on exercise-induced changes in the E:I balance would determine the magnitude of motor skill acquisition. To test this, we measured exercise-induced changes in excitation and inhibition using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 22 healthy female and male humans, and then had participants learn a novel motor skill  the sequential visual isometric pinch task (SVIPT). We examined the effect of D2 receptor blockade (800 mg sulpiride) on these measures within a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Our key result was that motor skill acquisition was driven by an interaction between the D2 receptor and E:I balance. Speci  cally, poorer skill learning was related to an attenuated shift in the E:I balance in the sulpiride condition, whereas this interaction was not evident in placebo. Our results demonstrate that exercise-primed motor skill acquisition is causally in  uenced by D2 receptor activity on motor cortical circuits.

Exercise is known to bene  t the ability to acquire new motor skills, but the neural mechanisms driving this phenomenon are notwellunderstood.Wetestedwhethertheeffectsofexerciseoncorticalneurophysiologyandmotorskilllearningwasdueto dopaminergic neuromodulation. We obtained measures of cortical excitation and inhibition before and after high-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise, and then had participants learn a novel motor skill. We provide causal evidence that motor skill acquisition is driven by an interaction between the dopamine D2 receptor and exercise-induced shifts in the cortical excita- tion/inhibition balance. Such  ndings have implications for prescribing exercise to improve motor learning in disorders of dopamine dysfunction, such as Parkinson s disease.

Evidence from human neuroimaging and genotyping studies, and from animal models, demonstrates that dopamine, particu- larly the D2 receptor, plays a crucial role in motor learning[(Floel et al., 2005](#_page7_x43.00_y295.99); [Badgaiyan et al., 2007](#_page6_x300.00_y409.99); [Yin et al., 2009](#_page8_x300.00_y238.99); [Beeler et al.](#_page6_x300.00_y503.99), [2010](#_page6_x300.00_y503.99); [Pearson-Fuhrhop et al., 2013](#_page7_x300.00_y314.99); [Sommer et al., 2014](#_page8_x43.00_y95.99); [Baetu et al., 2015](#_page6_x300.00_y427.99)). In murine models, motor learning worsens during blockade of D2 receptors and improves when the blockade is released [(Molina-Luna et al., 2009](#_page7_x300.00_y162.99); [Hosp et al., 2011](#_page7_x43.00_y465.99); [Beeler et al., 2012](#_page6_x300.00_y532.99)). In healthy adults, we recently demonstrated causal evidence that pharmacological blockade of the D2 receptor impairs the acquisition of a novel motor skill [(Taylor et al., 2023b](#_page8_x43.00_y247.99)). Further, it has also been shown that D2 receptors within the motor cortex are critical for regulating synaptic plasticity ([Molina-Luna et al., 2009](#_page7_x300.00_y162.99); [Hosp et al., 2011](#_page7_x43.00_y465.99); [Monte-Silva et al., 2011](#_page7_x300.00_y190.99)), a process that is fundamental in the formation of newly learned motor skills ([Rioult-Pedotti et al., 2000](#_page7_x300.00_y456.99); [Ziemann et al., 2004](#_page8_x300.00_y276.99); [Dayan and Cohen, 2011](#_page7_x43.00_y114.99); [Guo et al., 2015](#_page7_x43.00_y342.99); [Peters et al., 2017](#_page7_x300.00_y342.99)).

In addition to driving motor skill acquisition and plasticity, emerging evidence links the D2 receptor to the e  ects of exercise on brain function. For example, recent neuroimaging studies in healthy ageing [(Dang et al., 2017](#_page7_x43.00_y86.99); [Kohncke et al., 2018](#_page7_x43.00_y570.99); [Jonasson et al., 2019](#_page7_x43.00_y494.99)) and models of dopamine dysfunction ([Fisher et al., 2004](#_page7_x43.00_y257.99), [2013](#_page7_x43.00_y219.99); [Vučcković et al., 2010](#_page8_x300.00_y133.99); [Petzinger et al., 2013](#_page7_x300.00_y361.99); [Robertson et al., 2016](#_page7_x300.00_y475.99); [Sacheli et al., 2019](#_page7_x300.00_y608.99)) have revealed a positive association between exercise and D2 receptor density and binding potential. Exercise interventions are also known to have a positive impact on the motor symptoms of dopaminergic disorders, such as Parkinson s disease ([Schenkman et al., 2018](#_page7_x300.00_y665.99); [van der Kolk et al., 2019](#_page8_x300.00_y95.99)). Building on these  ndings, our group ([Curtin et al., 2023](#_page6_x300.00_y712.99)) recently demon- strated that the D2 receptor causally modulates exercise-induced changes in motor cortical excitation and inhibition (i.e., the E:I balance), a process that is known to be crucial for acquiring new motor memories ([Rosenkranz et al., 2007](#_page7_x300.00_y551.99); [Coxon et al., 2014](#_page6_x300.00_y674.99); [Kida et al., 2016](#_page7_x43.00_y532.99); [Vallentin et al., 2016](#_page8_x300.00_y67.99); [Kolasinski et al.](#_page7_x43.00_y598.99), [2019](#_page7_x43.00_y598.99)). Together, these lines of evidence indicate that D2 receptor activity (1) modulates skill acquisition and (2) is a  ected by exer- cise.Althoughgeneticassociationstudieshaveexploredthepoten- tial role of D2 receptors in exercise-related changes in motor learning ([Mang et al., 2017](#_page7_x43.00_y674.99); [Christiansen et al., 2019](#_page6_x300.00_y636.99)), we lack direct causal evidence that the D2 receptor modulates exercise- primed motor skill acquisition via an e  ect on E:I balance.

Here, we examined how the modulatory e  ect of the dopa- mine D2 receptor on exercise-induced changes in the E:I balance

interact with motor skill acquisition. We combined paired-pulse transcranialmagneticstimulation(TMS)withapharmacological manipulation involving the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride (800 mg), within a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled design. A key advantage of sulpiride is that it is a highly selective D2 antagonist at a high 800 mg dose, acting pre- dominantly on postsynaptic receptors, with a low a  nity for D1 and nondopamine receptors ([Miyamoto et al., 2005](#_page7_x300.00_y133.99)). We pre- dictedthatpoorerskilllearningwouldberelatedtoanattenuated shift in the E:I balance in the sulpiride but not the placebo condition.

Materials and Methods

We previously reported on the e  ects of D2 blockade on exercise-induced changes in the E:I balance [(Curtin et al., 2023](#_page6_x300.00_y712.99)) and motor skill learning ([Taylor et al., 2023b](#_page8_x43.00_y247.99)) as part of a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover design involving two experimental sessions. Given our focus here on exercise-primed changes in cortical activity and motor skill acquisition, the analyses reported below are restricted to E:I balance and motor learning data obtained in sessionone;i.e.,drugisabetween-subjectsfactorinanalyses,andallpar- ticipantswerenaivetotheSVIPTtask.Pleaserefertothepreviousstudies for CONSORT protocols and full TMS and motor learning procedures ([Curtin et al., 2023](#_page6_x300.00_y712.99); [Taylor et al., 2023b](#_page8_x43.00_y247.99)).

Participants. We tested 22 healthy adults ([Table 1](#_page1_x34.00_y584.99)). Exclusion crite- ria were age <18 or >40 years, females not on hormonal contraception ([Taylor et al., 2023a](#_page8_x43.00_y266.99)), recent use of psychotropic medication, and a per- sonalhistoryofneurological disease orpsychiatric illness[(Sheehan etal., 1998](#_page7_x300.00_y712.99)). Those with contraindications to TMS ([Rossi et al., 2009](#_page7_x300.00_y579.99)) or high- intensity exercise [(Sports Medicine Australia, 2011](#_page8_x43.00_y114.99)) were also excluded. As part of a larger project, sample size estimations were conducted a pri- ori to detect within-subject e  ects of sulpiride on exercise-primed changes in the E:I balance [(Curtin et al., 2023](#_page6_x300.00_y712.99)) and motor skill learning ([Taylor et al., 2023b](#_page8_x43.00_y247.99)). Although we did not perform speci  c analyses to detect between-subjects e  ects, our sample size is in line with other related pharmacological challenge (e.g.,[Nitsche et al., 2009](#_page7_x300.00_y266.99); [Monte- Silva et al., 2011](#_page7_x300.00_y190.99)) and exercise and motor learning studies (e.g., [StavrinosandCoxon,2017](#_page8_x43.00_y162.99);[Tayloretal.,2024](#_page8_x43.00_y219.99)).Allparticipantsprovided written informed consent. The experimental procedures were conducted inaccordancewiththeDeclarationofHelsinkiandwereapprovedbythe Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee.

Experimental design.We used a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design. Participants were orally administered either one capsule of sulpiride (800 mg) or an identical-looking placebo capsule containing microcrystalline cellulose. Drug allocation was pre-determined according to a randomization schedule set by a third

party. The preparation and administration of the study drug was over- seen byan independent researcher not involved in recruitment, data col- lection, or analysis. Investigators and participants remained blinded to drug condition until the study was complete.

We timed the exercise [(Fig. 1A](#_page2_x34.00_y761.99)) to occur at the peak plasma concen- tration of sulpiride, which is known to occur at 3 h ([Helmy, 2013](#_page7_x43.00_y390.99)). To monitor subjective mood throughout the experimental session, we administered the Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scale [(Bond and Lader, 1974](#_page6_x300.00_y570.99)) every hour. Sessions were scheduled in the morning to ensure that diurnal in  uences could not confound outcome measures. There were no di  erences in the time of day of sessions between drug groups (independent samples t test, p=0.51).

High-intensityintervalexercise.Exercisewasperformedonastation- ary cycle ergometer (Wattbike Atom). The intensity was tailored to each participant based on their estimated heart rate reserve, calculated as the di  erence between maximum and resting heart rate. The exercise proto- colconsisted ofalternating intervalsof3 min ofcyclingat50%heart rate reserve, and 2 min of cycling at up to∼90% heart rate reserve, for a total duration of 20 min ([Stavrinos and Coxon, 2017](#_page8_x43.00_y162.99); [Andrews et al., 2020](#_page6_x300.00_y342.99)).

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Monophasic TMS pulses were applied to the dominant primary motor cortex using a   gure-of-eight coil (70 mm wing diameter), connected to two Magstim

2002 magnetic stimulators via a Bistim2 module (Magstim Company Ltd.). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded using surface elec- tromyography (EMG) from the  rst dorsal interosseous muscle of the dominant hand using Ag  AgCl electrodes (Ambu White Sensor WS, Ambu), arranged in a belly-tendon montage and secured with sports tape.

For SICI, the conditioning stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce 50% inhibition of the nonconditioned MEP at baseline, with an interstimulus interval of

J.Neurosci.,May8,2024  44(19):e2028232024  3

2 ms. The same conditioning and test stimulus intensities were used for ICF but with a 12 ms interval. For both SICI and ICF, the amplitude of the conditioned MEP was expressed as a ratio of the amplitude of the nonconditioned MEP. For all single- and paired-pulse measures, 16 sti- muli were delivered at 5 s intervals (–20% jitter).

To characterize the e  ects of excitatory and inhibitory cortical activity, we calculated an excitation/inhibition ratio ([Andrews et al., 2020](#_page6_x300.00_y342.99); [Curtin et al., 2023](#_page6_x300.00_y712.99)) using data obtained from SICI and ICF. In this ratio, larger E:I values represents a combination of increased excitation and reduced inhibition.

Motor skill learning. Motor learning was assessed using a sequential visual isometric pinch task (SVIPT) [(Reis et al., 2009](#_page7_x300.00_y418.99)). Participants were seated in front of a computer while holding a force transducer between the thumb and index  nger of their dominant hand. Squeezing the force transducer produced a proportional movement of a cursor. In each trial, participants were presented with  ve colored targets located along a hor- izontalaxis[(Fig.1C](#_page2_x34.00_y761.99)).Theywereinstructedtoproduce  vepulsesofforce to move the cursor to each target as quickly and accurately as possible according to a speci  ed color sequence (red-blue-green-yellow-white). The amount of force required to reach the furthest target was set at 45% of each participant s maximum voluntary pinch contraction (MVC).

Task version was counterbalanced across drug groups, such that for both placebo and sulpiride, half of the participants (5/11 participants) completed SVIPTA while the other half (6/11 participants) completed SVIPTB. Target locations in both task versions were pseudor- andomly shu  ed between three di  erent orders ([Fig. 1C](#_page2_x34.00_y761.99) for the varia- tions used in SVIPTA and SVIPTB). For both tasks, participants completed nine familiarization trials. They then completed 12 blocks of 12 trials. Participants were shown a visual representation of their

calculated skill level after each block, to assess their progress and to encourage improvement.

To assess motor skill learning, performance on the SVIPT was assessed by calculating a skill measure for which higher values re  ect a shift in the speed  accuracy trade-o  function towards faster and more accurate task performance, per the procedures previously outlined ([Reis et al., 2009](#_page7_x300.00_y418.99);[Stavrinos and Coxon, 2017](#_page8_x43.00_y162.99)). Skill is de  ned as follows:

1− force error

Skill parameter= force error ∗(log (duration)a),

wheredurationreferstothemeantrialtimefortheblockandthevalueof a is1.627[(StavrinosandCoxon,2017](#_page8_x43.00_y162.99)).Theskillmeasureusedinanalysis was the logarithm of this skill parameter, to ensure homogeneity of var- iance across participants ([Reis et al., 2009](#_page7_x300.00_y418.99)).

Data analysis. We constructed a linear mixed model to evaluate the interactionbetween motor skillacquisition andthe E:Ibalance under D2 receptor blockade. We examined motor skill acquisition (our dependent variable) by comparing the start of learning (average of blocks 1 and 2) and the end of learning (average of blocks 11 and 12) [(Stavrinos and Coxon, 2017](#_page8_x43.00_y162.99)). The linear mixed model was constructed using a model selection approach in which variables of interest were entered into the model and were retained based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC), as well as a theoretical justi  cation([MeteyardandDavies,2020](#_page7_x43.00_y740.99)).The  nalmodelincluded  xed e  ects of Time Point (start of learning, end of learning), Drug (placebo, sulpiride), and  E:I balance (Postexercise  Baseline), with all interaction terms included. Participant was speci  ed as a random factor. Signi  cant interactions were followed up using Bonferroni-adjusted contrasts of model estimates and trends.

Finally, we tested whether the relationship between the E:I balance (independent variable) and motor skill (dependent variable) was moder- ated by sulpiride (moderating variable). To do so, we ran a moderation analysis using the PROCESS macro [(Hayes, 2017](#_page7_x43.00_y371.99)). For this analysis, we calculated the  skill, de  ned as the di  erence between the start of learning (average of blocks 1 and 2), and the end of learning (average of blocks 11 and 12). E:I balance was mean centerd to avoid multicolli- nearity ([Hayes, 2017](#_page7_x43.00_y371.99)). Analyses were implemented in R Studio version 2,023.06.0+421 and JASP version 0.17.1, with anα set at 0.05.

Exercise analysis.Heart rate, cadence, and power (Watts) were col- lected at 1 s intervals. Subjective ratings of perceived exertion[ (Borg, 1970](#_page6_x300.00_y589.99)) were collected at the end of each minute.

There were no di  erences in exercise parameters between the sulpiride and placebo groups (all p>0.12;[Fig. 1B ](#_page2_x34.00_y761.99)and [Table 2](#_page3_x292.00_y76.99)), verifying that participants exercised to a similar level in both groups.

D2 antagonism by sulpiride blocked the exercise-induced changes in E:I balance and motor skill acquisition ([Fig. 2) ](#_page4_x34.00_y431.99)Sulpiride eliminated exercise-induced changes in the E:I balance (independent samples t test, t(20) =3.50, p=0.002, Cohen s d = 1.49;[Fig. 2A](#_page4_x34.00_y431.99)) and also resulted in attenuated learn- ing when acquiring the motor skill (independent samples t test, t(20) =3.19,p=0.005, Cohen s d=1.36;[Fig. 2B](#_page4_x34.00_y431.99)).

Motor skill acquisition depends on the interaction between dopaminergic and motor cortical activity

Our main result was a Drug Time Point E:I balance interac- tion,F(1,18) =6.12,p=0.02([Fig.3](#_page5_x34.00_y370.99)).Bonferroni-adjustedcontrasts showed a signi  cant di  erence in the linear trend between skill performance and the E:I balance at the start compared to the end

of learning for sulpiride [b  =0.04, 95% CI (0.004, 0.08),p=0.03] but not for placebo [b  =−0.01, 95% CI (−0.06, 0.18),p=0.89]. In

other words, motor skill acquisition was related to shifts in the E:I balance in the sulpiride condition, whereas this relationship was not evident in the placebo condition ([Fig. 3B](#_page5_x34.00_y370.99)).

Next, we tested whether sulpiride moderated the relationship between the E:I balance and the acquisition of the motor skill ([Fig. 3C](#_page5_x34.00_y370.99)). This model showed that Drug and  E:I balance accounted for a signi  cant proportion of the variability in  skill,

R=0.73, R2 =0.54, F =0.04, p=0.003. Critically, there was (3,18)

also a Drug E:I balance interaction [coe  cient=0.11, standard error=0.04, 95% CI=(0.02, 0.19),t=2.47, p=0.02]. Follow-up analyses showed this e  ect was driven by the sulpiride condition [coe  cient=0.08, standard error=0.03, 95% CI=(0.02, 0.15),

Control analyses

To determine whether the mild sedative e  ects of sulpiride impacted task performance ([Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 1997](#_page7_x300.00_y67.99)), we compared participants  subjective ratings of mood (i.e., Bond and Lader scores) ([Bond and Lader, 1974](#_page6_x300.00_y570.99)) using mixed ANOVA tests. The factors of alertness, calmness, and content- ness were used [(Eisenegger et al., 2014](#_page7_x43.00_y152.99); [Curtin et al., 2023](#_page6_x300.00_y712.99); [Mikus et al., 2023](#_page7_x300.00_y95.99)). This analysis showed that subjective ratings did not di  er across drug conditions (all p>0.12) (Fig, [4](#_page5_x34.00_y591.99)). Although participants reported decreased calmness immediately followingexercise(p<0.001)[(DietrichandAudi  ren,2011](#_page7_x43.00_y133.99)),this did not di  er between drug groups. Overall, these analyses sug- gest that our results are not explainable by a sedative e  ect of sulpiride.

As an additional control analysis, we tested whether di  er- ences in subthreshold muscle activity prior to the TMS pulse (de  ned as a root mean square value ≤10 V in the resting state EMG trace) explained our TMS results. Importantly, mixed ANOVA tests showed no main e  ects of Drug or Drug Time interaction e  ects for SICI or ICF (allp>0.09), verifying that our E:I balance results are not attributable to subthreshold

di  erences in the level of background resting state EMG across the two drug groups.

Lastly, we examined whether the task version (i.e., SVIPTA and SVIPTB) in  uenced our results. While a between-subjects ANOVA showed a main e  ect of Task Version (p=0.006), there was no interaction between Task Version and Drug (p=0.95), indicating that task version did not contribute to the di  erence in motor skill acquisition across drug groups.

Discussion

We tested the e  ects of D2 receptor blockade on exercise-induced changes in motor cortical excitation/inhibition (E:I) balance and the acquisition of a novel motor skill using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Our key result was that skill acquisition was driven by an interaction betweentheD2receptorandE:Ibalance.Speci  cally,poorerskill acquisition was related to an attenuated shift in the E:I balance under D2 blockade, whereas this relationship was not evident in placebo. Critically, these  ndings were not attributable to group di  erences in exercise intensity, baseline motor perfor- mance, subjective mood ratings, background muscle activity, or the implicit force-cursor transformation used in our motor skill learning task. These results demonstrate that exercise modulates motor skill learning through a causal in  uence of D2 receptor activity on excitatory and inhibitory motor cortical circuits.

Our  ndings buildonbehavioral  genetic studies[(Mangetal., 2017](#_page7_x43.00_y674.99);[Christiansen et al., 2019](#_page6_x300.00_y636.99)), which investigated the in  uence

<a name="_page5_x34.00_y591.99"></a>of D2-related genes on exercise and motor learning. These stud- ies showed that individuals with a genetic predisposition for reduced D2 receptor availability had diminished bene  ts of exer- cise on motor memory consolidation. However, a key limitation of these studies was that they lacked a true experimental design and did not assess the underlying neurophysiological mecha- nisms. These are pertinent considerations given that the results could be explained by other functions of the D2 receptor. For example, the D2 receptor is known to be critical in reward pro- cesses [(Eisenegger et al., 2014](#_page7_x43.00_y152.99)) and working memory ([Naef et al., 2017](#_page7_x300.00_y238.99)), both of which could have a  ected aspects of motor skill learning (e.g., see[Seidler et al., 2012](#_page7_x300.00_y693.99); [Galea et al., 2015](#_page7_x43.00_y323.99); [Holland et al., 2019](#_page7_x43.00_y427.99)). Critically, by administering a highly

selective D2 agent, sulpiride [(Miyamoto et al., 2005](#_page7_x300.00_y133.99)), in a con- trolled prospective experimental design, we show that the D2 receptor drives exercise-primed motor skill acquisition. Additionally, by demonstrating a direct link to the motor cor- tical E:I balance, our results suggest that this e  ect is related to a speci  c function of D2 receptors on motor cortex neurophysiology.

A question raised by our data is why there was a relationship between the E:I balance and exercise-induced changes in skill acquisition in the sulpiride but not the placebo condition. In the placebo condition, most people (82% ofparticipants) showed a positive change in the E:I balance (i.e., shift toward increased excitation and reduced inhibition), but the magnitude of these

changes was not related to  skill. This result could be attributed to the E:I balance being a proxy taken from the motor cortex, whereas the SVIPT motor learning task relies on complex visuo- motor processing across a distributed network of brain regions ([Krakauer et al., 2019](#_page7_x43.00_y655.99)). In contrast, in the sulpiride condition, most people (82% of participants) showed a minimal or negative change in the E:I balance (i.e., a shift towards reduced excitation andincreased inhibition).Importantly, inpeople wheresulpiride had minimal e  ect on the E:I balance, this was associated with better learning, whereas in those with a more negative shift in the E:I balance, this was related to poorer skill acquisition. These results suggest that D2 receptor blockade disrupted exercise-induced shifts in the E:I balance and skill learning. An interesting avenue for future research will be to explore the fac- tors that determine individual di  erences in such responses, including for example, drug pharmacokinetics, dopamine geno- types, and D2 receptor availability. In addition, it would also be interesting to examine the relationship between the E:I balance and skill performance at the end of learning. [Mooney et al. (2021)](#_page7_x300.00_y219.99) recently showed a bidirectional change in motor excita- tion (measured by ICF) following short and longer skill acquisi- tion blocks. We did not repeat our TMS measures after skill learning due to our long experimental protocol (>4 h) and because of the reduced e  cacy of sulpiride past this time. Future work may consider adding a postlearning measure to explore how exercise and/or the D2 receptor a  ects learning- mediated changes in the E:I balance.

From a mechanistic perspective, our  ndings have several potential explanations. A likely interpretation is that exercise-induced shifts in the E:I balance are regulated by D2 function([Curtinetal.,2023](#_page6_x300.00_y712.99)),whichtogethermodulatetheacqui- sitionofanovel motorskill.Thisaccountisconsistentwithsepa- rate lines of evidence showing that (1) transient shifts in the E:I balance are critical for memory acquisition and consolidation (e.g., see[Kida et al., 2016](#_page7_x43.00_y532.99); [Vallentin et al., 2016](#_page8_x300.00_y67.99); [Stavrinos and Coxon, 2017](#_page8_x43.00_y162.99);[Koolschijn et al., 2019](#_page7_x43.00_y627.99)) and (2) that motor cortical activity and motor plasticity are modulated by the D2 receptor (e.g., see[Meintzschel and Ziemann, 2006](#_page7_x43.00_y712.99); [Molina-Luna et al., 2009](#_page7_x300.00_y162.99); [Hosp et al., 2011](#_page7_x43.00_y465.99); [Monte-Silva et al., 2011](#_page7_x300.00_y190.99)). In addition to a  ecting motor cortical circuits, changes in the dopamine sys- tem could also alter other neural processes involved in motor learning. For example, exercise is known to modulateβ-band oscillatoryactivity[(DalMasoetal.,2018](#_page6_x300.00_y741.99))andthereleaseofbrain derived neurotrophic factor ([Saucedo Marquez et al., 2015](#_page7_x300.00_y636.99)), both of which areclosely tiedwith dopamine[(Bastioli et al.,2022](#_page6_x300.00_y465.99)) and motor learning ([Pollok et al., 2014](#_page7_x300.00_y390.99); [Espenhahn et al., 2019](#_page7_x43.00_y181.99)). Taken together, these lines of evidence highlight a mechanistic pathway through which dopaminergic activity involving the D2 receptor modulates exercise-primed motor learning.

Clinically, exercise is widely prescribed to people with dopa- minergic disorders such as Parkinson s disease, based on strong evidence that it can alleviate motor symptomatology ([Schenkman et al., 2018](#_page7_x300.00_y665.99); [van der Kolk et al., 2019](#_page8_x300.00_y95.99)). While long- term trials examining the e  ects of regular exercise on motor learning in Parkinson s disease are lacking, several recent studies have shown that a single session of exercise can improve various stagesofmotorlearning(e.g.,[Steibetal.,2018](#_page8_x43.00_y190.99);[Wanneretal.,2021](#_page8_x300.00_y200.99)). However, the mechanisms driving these e  ects are poorly understood. Our results point to the D2 (indirect) cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical pathway [(Petzinger et al., 2013](#_page7_x300.00_y361.99)) and projections from the ventral tegmental area to motor cortex ([Hospetal.,2011](#_page7_x43.00_y465.99))ascandidatepathwaysthroughwhichexercise could a  ect motor learning. Although this account needs to be

veri  ed in the Parkinson s disease population, a key strength of our results is that they are not confounded by other disease-related factors (e.g., age, dopaminergic medications, and involvement of nondopamine systems) that could obscure the precise mechanistic pathways involved in exercise-primed motor learning. In addition to these mechanistic insights, our results suggest that the timing of dopaminergic medications could also be a key factor in prescribing exercise to alleviate motor learning de  cits in Parkinson s disease.

A limitation of the current study was that the size of our drug groupswasmodest(n=11sulpiride;n=11placebo).Strengthsof our study design that help to safeguard against this limitation are that we used a rigorous procedure (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design), as well as a highly selective dopami- nergic agent, which we expected to produce strong neurophysio- logical [(Monte-Silva et al., 2011](#_page7_x300.00_y190.99)) and behavioral ([Eisenegger et al., 2014](#_page7_x43.00_y152.99); [Naef et al., 2017](#_page7_x300.00_y238.99); [Mikus et al., 2023](#_page7_x300.00_y95.99)) e  ects.

Overall, our results demonstrate that D2 blockade alters the relationship between motor skill learning and excitatory and inhibitory (i.e., E:I balance) circuits within the motor cortex. These results provide evidence that exercise modulates motor skill learning through an interaction between dopaminergic activity and excitatory and inhibitory motor cortical circuits.
