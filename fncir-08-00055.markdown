The spinal cord contains networks of neurons that can produce locomotor patterns. To readily respond to environmental conditions, these networks must be flexible yet at the same time robust. Neuromodulators play a key role in contributing to network flexibility in a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate networks. For example, neuromodulators contribute to altering intrinsic properties and synaptic weights that, in extreme cases, can lead to neurons switching between networks. Here we focus on the role of dopamine in the control of stepping networks in the spinal cord. We first review the role of dopamine in modulating rhythmic activity in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) and the leech, since work from these preparations provides a foundation to understand its role in vertebrate systems. We then move to a discussion of dopamine’s role in modulation of swimming in aquatic species such as the larval xenopus, lamprey and zebrafish.The control of terrestrial walking in vertebrates by dopamine is less studied and we review current evidence in mammals with a focus on rodent species. We discuss data suggesting that the source of dopamine within the spinal cord is mainly from the A11 area of the diencephalon, and then turn to a discussion of dopamine’s role in modulating walking patterns from both in vivo and in vitro preparations. Similar to the descending serotonergic system, the dopaminergic system may serve as a potential target to promote recovery of locomotor function following spinal cord injury (SCI); evidence suggests that dopaminergic agonists can promote recovery of function following SCI. We discuss pharmacogenetic and optogenetic approaches that could be deployed in SCI and their potential tractability. Throughout the review we draw parallels with both noradrenergic and serotonergic modulatory effects on spinal cord networks. In all likelihood, a complementary monoaminergic enhancement strategy should be deployed following SCI.

Neuromodulatorsarethekeyingredientallowingmotornetworks the flexibility to produce multiple patterns of output. When one considers a task such as stepping, a number of patterns need to be produced to run, walk, hop, go up and down inclines and walk in a circular pattern. While we focus on stepping in this review, neuromodulators contribute to the rhythmic opera- tion of most, if not all, biological networks. A complete under- standing of the role of neuromodulators in motor control must take into account the combinatorial effects of the complement of transmitters released both synaptically and extrasynaptically. This is an immense challenge for the field of motor control, especially when small invertebrate motor circuits are compared directly with their larger, less accessible and more complex mam- malian cousins. However, in the last decade new genetic tools have become available that allow spinal circuits that compose a motor network to be identified ([Goulding, 2009).](#_page12_x35.72_y483.67) In addition, the birth of optogenetics and pharmacogenetics has provided![ref1]

advanced tools for activating and inactivating neuromodulatory systems [(Shapiro et al., 2012;](#_page14_x293.50_y237.59)[ Aston-Jones and Deisseroth, 2013](#_page11_x35.72_y275.33)). Even with these new tools it will still be a challenge to exam- ine and comprehend the combinatorial role of multiple neu- rotransmitters, but the task is more tractable than it has been historically.

Although many neuropeptides, hormones or monoamines can modulate motor circuits, our review will focus on the role of dopamine. Dopamine plays an important role in the activation and modulation of the motor system across a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate species ([Harris-Warrick et al.,](#_page12_x293.50_y190.27) [1998; ](#_page12_x293.50_y190.27)[Svensson et al., 2003;](#_page14_x293.50_y521.53)[ Puhl and Mesce, 2008;](#_page14_x35.72_y407.95)[ Miles and Sillar, 2011;](#_page13_x293.50_y568.85)[ Clemens et al., 2012;](#_page11_x293.50_y559.88)[ Lambert et al., 2012](#_page13_x35.72_y502.60)). In humans, movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and Restless Leg Syndrome provide prime examples of what can happen and how debilitating it can be for the individual when the dopaminergic systemiscompromised.Becauseofthis,alargedegreeofefforthas

Early exploration of the role of catecholamines in locomotor a sobering realization considering the complexity of spinal cord behaviors in the 1960’s determined that L-DOPA could modulate CPG circuits. What we can learn from work on invertebrates is reflex circuits and promote locomotor activity, although at the that a neuromodulator can have a strong influence on individual time it was thought to be of noradrenergic origin ([Jankowska ](#_page12_x293.50_y493.14)cells, and even differential effects on individual cells in a circuit. [et al., 1967a](#_page12_x293.50_y493.14)[,b](#_page12_x293.50_y530.99);[ Grillner and Zangger](#_page12_x35.72_y530.99),[ 1979](#_page12_x35.72_y530.99)). For many years, However,ifwearetounderstandtheoverallmodulationofmotor L-DOPA was used to evoke locomotor activity in spinalized behavior we need to consider the combinatorial actions of many cats. It was later demonstrated that L-DOPA could promote air neuromodulators on network function and not simply one in stepping in the neonatal rodent ([Sickles et al.,](#_page14_x293.50_y341.70) [1992;](#_page14_x293.50_y341.70)[ McCrea](#_page13_x293.50_y360.63) isolation.

Furthermore, a change in network output pattern can antagonists ([Sickles et al.](#_page14_x293.50_y341.70),[ 1992](#_page14_x293.50_y341.70)).

More specifically, serotonin A17 [(Carlsson et al.](#_page11_x293.50_y285.41),[ 1962](#_page11_x293.50_y285.41);[ Dahlström and Fuxe](#_page12_x35.72_y86.16),[ 1964a](#_page12_x35.72_y86.16)[; Hökfelt ](#_page12_x293.50_y360.63)reduces release of glycine whereas noradrenaline increases glycine [et al., 1984a](#_page12_x293.50_y360.63)). Advances in immunohistochemical methods were release from these terminals onto motor neurons ([McDearmid ](#_page13_x293.50_y398.49)later used to identify cells that express other enzymes involved [et al., 1997](#_page13_x293.50_y398.49)). In the larval X*enopus*locomotor network, dopamine in the synthesis of catecholamines such as aromatic amino acid reduces locomotor activity via D2-like mechanisms at low con- decarboxylase (AADC), dopamine-b-hydroxylase (D H) and centrations (1–5 mM) and promotes locomotor activity at higher phenylethanolamine-N-methyl-transferase (PNMT; **[Figure 1**](#_page3_x346.62_y561.64)**). concentrations (10–50 mM) via D1-like mechanisms [(Clemens](#_page11_x293.50_y559.88) These developments allowed for further characterization between [et al., 2012](#_page11_x293.50_y559.88)). The precise neuronal populations being acted on the types of catecholamine-producing cells. The original view are unknown. The development of limbed locomotion in the frog that catecholamine-producing cell types consist of dopaminergic, from swimming in the tadpole affords a unique opportunity to noradrenergic, and adrenergic classes has been expanded and study the developmental and potentially evolutionary reconfig-

with both immature limbs and a tail for swimming still intact, 

both noradrenaline and serotonin bias locomotor network output 

controlling either the tail or the developing legs. Specifically, 

serotonin acts to slow rhythmic tail-associated swimming activity 

and speeds up the limb-associated activity, whereas noradrenaline 

will speed up tail-associated swimming activity and slow down 

limb-associated activity. This provides yet another example of 

opposing aminergic modulation of distinct spinal locomotor cir- 

cuits and their functional coupling during amphibian metamor- 

phosis ([Rauscent et al., 2009](#_page14_x35.72_y530.99)). These are similar to modulatory

the STG [(Gutierrez et al., 2013](#_page12_x35.72_y616.17)) and expression of swimming and

**BIOCHEMICAL AND NEUROANATOMICAL ASPECTS OF DESCENDING DOPAMINERGIC SYSTEMS IN MAMMALS**

Walking behavior in terrestrial legged mammals recruits up to 80 

individual muscles. While the activity of all of them has not been 

measured during walking, all indications are that each muscle 

generates a uniquely patterned burst. This adds another layer of 

complexity to aquatic based species by adding on components 

of the network that produce not only left-right alternation but 

also coordination of flexor and extensor muscles within limbs.

Dopamine modulation of rhythmic networks

there is evidence of enzymatic diversity within each class. For example, some TH positive cells lack any enzymes for conversion to traditional catecholamine neurons. Others have a portion, but not all, of the enzymatic machinery. A prime example of these cells are the D-cells which contain AADC but lack TH and are situated around the central canal of the spinal cord ([Jaeger et al.](#_page12_x293.50_y455.28),[ 1983](#_page12_x293.50_y455.28)). They are similar in location and structure to the dopamine-producing LC cells in the lamprey spinal cord ([Ochi et al., 1979](#_page14_x35.72_y114.55);[ McPherson and Kemnitz, 1994](#_page13_x293.50_y530.99);[ Pierre et al.](#_page14_x35.72_y303.84), [1997](#_page14_x35.72_y303.84)) and the AADCC/TH  D cells of the zebrafish spinal cord ([Chatelin et al., 2001](#_page11_x293.50_y332.74)). While the function of these cells is not clear, the bottom line is that catecholaminergic phenotypes are more complex than originally thought. Nevertheless, cells that express TH, AADC and are DbH negative can still provide a good indication that the cells may be dopaminergic whereas the DbH positive cells could be either noradrenergic or adrenergic. Such criteria permitted for the identification of nine major dopamin- ergic nuclei in the brain ([Björklund and Dunnett, 2007).](#_page11_x35.72_y588.16) The canonical dopaminergic cell would also express machinery for dopamine release such as a vesicular monoaminergic transporter (VMAT2) to pump dopamine into vesicles, a reuptake transporter like the dopamine transporter (DAT) and a means of regulat- ing release of dopamine such as presynaptic D2 autoreceptors ([Ugrumov,](#_page14_x293.50_y682.43) [2009](#_page14_x293.50_y682.43)). It is important to note however that some dopamine neurons differentially express D2 autoreceptors. The mechanisms of actions at the soma and terminals may also be different (G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) versus Kv1.2 respectively) and some THC neu- rons may not even express them at all ([Pappas et al.,](#_page14_x35.72_y171.34) [2008; ](#_page14_x35.72_y171.34)[Ford, 2014](#_page12_x35.72_y218.66)). Therefore, expression of D2 autoreceptors may not be a pre-requisite of a canonical dopamine cell, but may be a common feature. In fact, diversity appears the rule rather than the exception for catecholaminergic cell types [(Ugrumov, 2009](#_page14_x293.50_y682.43)).

**DESCENDING CATECHOLAMINERGIC PROJECTIONS** The predominant sources of spinal dopamine and noradrenaline

in mammals are the descending fibers projecting from the dopaminergic A10 and A11 nuclei of the posterior hypothalamus ([Björklund and Skagerberg, 1979](#_page11_x35.72_y607.09)[; Lindvall et al., 1983](#_page13_x293.50_y57.77)[; Skagerberg and Lindvall](#_page14_x293.50_y407.95),[ 1985](#_page14_x293.50_y407.95);[ Qu et al.](#_page14_x35.72_y436.35),[ 2006](#_page14_x35.72_y436.35);[ Pappas et al.](#_page14_x35.72_y171.34),[ 2008](#_page14_x35.72_y171.34)), the A13 of the dorsal hypothalamus ([Blessing and Chalmers](#_page11_x35.72_y645.45),[ 1979](#_page11_x35.72_y645.45)) and the pontine noradrenergic A5, A6 (locus coeruleus) and A7 nuclei ([Fritschy and Grzanna,](#_page12_x35.72_y275.45) [1990;](#_page12_x35.72_y275.45)[ Clark and Proudfit,](#_page11_x293.50_y522.03) [1991; ](#_page11_x293.50_y522.03)[Bruinstroop et al.,](#_page11_x293.50_y162.38) [2012](#_page11_x293.50_y162.38)). While these regions appear to be conserved in many mammalian species including primates and humans ([Moore and Bloom, 1979;](#_page13_x293.50_y654.03) [Barraud et al.,](#_page11_x35.72_y417.30) [2010),](#_page11_x35.72_y417.30) we will focus on these regions with emphasis on rodent anatomy as they are best described in these species. The A11 is a small nucleus in the posterior hypothalamus consisting of approximately 150– 300 neurons ([**Figure 2**)](#_page4_x88.84_y666.24) and is the primary source of spinal dopamine in mammalian species. A11 neurons are thought to

be L-DOPAergic based on the absence of AADC in non-human primates, although the evidence in rodents is mixed ([Barraud](#_page11_x35.72_y417.30)

[et al., 2010](#_page11_x35.72_y417.30)). This suggests a possibility that L-DOPA release in the spinal cord of the non-human primate could be converted

to dopamine by other cells using spinally located AADC such as that present in the D cells near the central canal ([Jaeger et al., 1983](#_page12_x293.50_y455.28)).ItappearsthatdopaminergicneuronsintheA11goagainst what a canonical dopaminergic neuron would look like, since A11 neurons lack the reuptake transporter DAT ([Lorang et al., 1994; ](#_page13_x293.50_y124.02)[Ciliax et al.](#_page11_x293.50_y484.17),[ 1999](#_page11_x293.50_y484.17)) as well as D2 auto-receptors ([Pappas et al., 2008](#_page14_x35.72_y171.34)). The lack of D2 autoreceptors would presumably increase release probability for dopamine as well as TH enzyme activity ([Kehr et al., 1972](#_page13_x35.72_y256.52);[ Wolf and Roth](#_page15_x35.72_y294.38),[ 1990](#_page15_x35.72_y294.38);[ Benoit-Marand et al.](#_page11_x35.72_y559.77), [2001](#_page11_x35.72_y559.77);[ Ford](#_page12_x35.72_y218.66),[ 2014](#_page12_x35.72_y218.66)). One possibility is that the A11 phenotype serves as a compensatory adaptation given their few numbers in order to prolong the release, and increase synthesis, of dopamine

to their targets in the ventral horn.

Dopamine modulation of rhythmic networks

Although the A11 connectome is not well characterized, it has beenshown thatthe A11receivesinputs froma numberofregions including lateral septum, parabrachial nucleus, infralimbic cortex and the bed nucleus of the striata terminalis ([Abrahamson and Moore, 2001;](#_page11_x35.72_y218.55)[ Qu et al.](#_page14_x35.72_y436.35),[ 2006](#_page14_x35.72_y436.35)). The A11 also receives inputs from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), suggesting that A11 neurons maybemodulatedinacircadianpattern([Zhaoetal.,2007).](#_page15_x293.50_y86.16)There is evidence that this might be the case as the expression of the rate limiting enzyme TH is modulated in a circadian pattern, generating high levels of spinal dopamine during awake periods ([Hammar et al.,](#_page12_x35.72_y644.57) [2004).](#_page12_x35.72_y644.57) It has also been suggested that AADC is expressed in a circadian pattern, which may also describe the variable findings to date ([Björklund and Dunnett, 2007; ](#_page11_x35.72_y588.16)[Barraud et al., 2010](#_page11_x35.72_y417.30)).

The best characterized of the A11 efferent projections are the descending axons that travel through the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus of Schutz, located in the periaqueductal gray, and descend unilaterally through the dorsolateral funiculus into the superficial dorsal horn. A small number of axons also descend in the regions around the central canal and into the ventral horn ([Björklund and Skagerberg,](#_page11_x35.72_y607.09) [1979;](#_page11_x35.72_y607.09)[ Commissiong et al., 1979](#_page11_x293.50_y635.60); [Skagerberg and Lindvall](#_page14_x293.50_y407.95),[ 1985](#_page14_x293.50_y407.95)), with higher densities in the lumbar region relative to the thoracic regions ([Pappas et al., 2008](#_page14_x35.72_y171.34)). Several examples have been provided by[ Pappas et al. ](#_page14_x35.72_y171.34)([2008,](#_page14_x35.72_y171.34)[ 2010](#_page14_x35.72_y209.20)), indicating sexual dimorphism of the descending A11 system whereby males have a greater number of dopamin- ergic neurons and a higher density of descending fibers with no apparent difference in dopamine metabolism ([Pappas et al., 2008, ](#_page14_x35.72_y171.34)[2010](#_page14_x35.72_y209.20)). Overall, it has been suggested that this dimorphism, which is androgen-dependant ([Pappas et al., 2010),](#_page14_x35.72_y209.20) may contribute to the higher female prevalence of restless leg syndrome, a motor disorder associated with impairments in the spinal dopaminergic system [(Pappas et al.](#_page14_x35.72_y171.34),[ 2008](#_page14_x35.72_y171.34)). To better understand how the A11 exerts its influence on locomotor behavior, the connectivity of the A11 with other locomotor-related regions in the brain needs to be established. In addition to the spinal cord, A11 neurons project collaterals to the dorsal raphe nucleus and the prefrontal cortex ([Peyron et al., 1995](#_page14_x35.72_y275.45)). It is possible that other targets are likely.

In parallel to A11 projections, noradrenergic fibers of the A5, A6 and A7 travel through the lateral and ventral funiculi and dorsal surface of the dorsal horn. A particularly high density of fibers from the A5 can be found in the lateral region, A6 in the dorsal and ventral regions and A7 mainly in the lateral region. Previously the termination sites of descending noradrenergic pro- jections were controversial [(Fritschy and Grzanna, 1990](#_page12_x35.72_y275.45);[ Clark and Proudfit,](#_page11_x293.50_y522.03) [1991).](#_page11_x293.50_y522.03) More recent transgenic approaches have revealed that the A5 regions provides the densest innervation of the thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons, A6 densest in the dorsal horn at all levels of the spinal cord and the A7 densest in the ventral horn at all levels of the spinal cord ([Bruinstroop et al., 2012](#_page11_x293.50_y162.38)). Such an organization would suggest that the A5 nucleus would exert more of an influence over autonomic functions, A6 over modulation of sensory input and A7 to motor function. Interestingly, in regards to dopamine innervation of the spinal cord, there is also a clear autonomic innervation of the interme- diolateral nucleus of the spinal cord from the A11. Together with![ref2]

noradrenaline this suggests multiple effects of catecholamines on most inputs and outputs of the spinal cord.

Both descending dopaminergic and noradrenergic projections to the spinal cord share similarities in terms of fiber distribu- tion and points of innervation within the gray matter of the spinal cord, but there are differences in terms of fiber den- sity. Dopaminergic fibers appear to develop slower than nora- drenergic fibers. Noradrenergic fiber density appears to peak at 14 days after birth with some pruning taking place up to early adulthood. On the other hand dopamine fiber development occurs slowly throughout development in the spinal cord, peak- ing at early adulthood ([Commissiong,](#_page11_x293.50_y588.28) [1983).](#_page11_x293.50_y588.28) Generally speak- ing, the descending fibers heavily innervate the dorsal horns where catecholaminergic influence is exerted via diffuse paracrine release, whereas relatively less innervation of the ventral horn is reported, specifically in lamina IX where direct synaptic con- nections are made on medium to large dendrites with few axo- somatic synapses of motor neurons ([Yoshida and Tanaka,](#_page15_x293.50_y57.77) [1988; ](#_page15_x293.50_y57.77)[Rajaofetra et al.](#_page14_x35.72_y464.74),[ 1992](#_page14_x35.72_y464.74);[ Ridet et al., 1992](#_page14_x35.72_y644.57)). Much more is known about the nature of synaptic interaction of motor neurons by the descending noradrenergic and serotonergic fibers. Noradrenergic and serotonergic input to motor neuron pools have typically been described as diffuse [(Heckman et al.](#_page12_x293.50_y218.66),[ 2008](#_page12_x293.50_y218.66);[ Johnson and Heckman,](#_page13_x35.72_y57.77) [2010](#_page13_x35.72_y57.77)); however, recently the nature of synaptic targets was further described for noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons in cat splenius motor neurons ([Montague et al., 2013)](#_page13_x293.50_y616.17) and appear to be concentrated on small diameter distal dendrites of motor neurons with few located on somal targets. This distribution implies compartmentalization of synaptic contacts, which has also been suggested as playing an important role in regulating the input-output properties of motor neurons ([Montague et al., 2013](#_page13_x293.50_y616.17)).

**TARGETS OF SPINAL DOPAMINE**

Dopamine receptors are G-protein coupled receptors and are divided into two subfamilies; the D1-like receptors (D1 and D5) and the D2-like receptors (D2, D3, and D4). Generally, activation of the D1-like receptor subfamily elicits excitatory effects through a stimulatory G-protein (G sa) interacting with adenyl cyclase, subsequently increasing intracellular cAMP levels. In contrast, activation of the D2- receptor subfamily hyperpolarizes the cell membrane through an inhibitory G-protein (G ia) to close cal- cium channels, open potassium channels and reduce intracellular cAMP levels [(Missale et al.](#_page13_x293.50_y597.24),[ 1998](#_page13_x293.50_y597.24)). In the rodent, dopamine released from terminals in the lumbar spinal cord can act on all five dopamine receptors (D1–D5;[` `**Figure 2**)](#_page4_x88.84_y666.24) which are non-

uniformly distributed across the transverse lumbar spinal cord ([Zhu et al.,](#_page15_x293.50_y124.02) [2007](#_page15_x293.50_y124.02)). Similar to other monoamines, the distribu- tion of receptors is species dependent ([Barraud et al.,](#_page11_x35.72_y417.30) [2010) ](#_page11_x35.72_y417.30)and their density is likely also developmentally regulated as dopaminergic receptors are in other areas of the brain ([Tarazi and Baldessarini](#_page14_x293.50_y587.78),[ 2000](#_page14_x293.50_y587.78)). Little is known in respect of the ros- trocaudal distribution but higher levels of dopamine are found in cervical, opposed to lumbar, segments of the spinal cord ([Karoum et al.,](#_page13_x35.72_y190.27) [1981](#_page13_x35.72_y190.27)). In the juvenile mouse, D2-like recep- tor subtypes are strongly expressed in lamina I-III of the dor- sal horn with the predominant subtype being the D3 receptor

Even though descending catecholamine axons tend to degenerate following injury, D-cells may compensate by upregulating AADC [(Jaeger et al.](#_page12_x293.50_y455.28),[ 1983](#_page12_x293.50_y455.28)[; Li et al., 2014](#_page13_x35.72_y663.50)). In spinalized mice, administration of L-DOPA and buspirone (dopamine and 5-HT1 partial agonist) combined with apomorphine reliably elicited locomotor activity in mice with a complete spinal transection ([Guertin et al.,](#_page12_x35.72_y578.32) [2011).](#_page12_x35.72_y578.32) Work in decerebrate rats suggests that L-DOPA activation of locomotion is dopamine receptor dependent ([Sickles et al.,](#_page14_x293.50_y341.70) [1992;](#_page14_x293.50_y341.70)[ McCrea et al., 1997](#_page13_x293.50_y360.63)). In terms of translation, [Maric et al. ](#_page13_x293.50_y303.84)([2008)](#_page13_x293.50_y303.84) showed![ref2]

that oral administration of L-DOPA did not produce any observ- able change in locomotor recovery following SCI. It is not clear why L-DOPA may have proven ineffective but it is likely that a combination of multiple catecholaminergic agonists will need to be developed for humans in combination with other therapies. In this regard, the use of embryonic cells from the dopamin- ergic ventral tegmental region may also be a useful strategy, similar to approaches that have used embryonic noradrenergic locus coeruleus [(Commissiong, 1984](#_page11_x293.50_y607.21)) or serotonergic raphe cells implantedintotheinjurysite([Majczynski´ etal.,2005](#_page13_x293.50_y218.66);[Boidoetal.](#_page11_x35.72_y673.84), [2009](#_page11_x35.72_y673.84)).

It is useful to consider new genetic approaches that target monoaminergic sites. The field of optogenetics has developed methods to target classes of cells such that they can be excited or inhibited with light. This is accomplished by the insertion of light sensitive cation channels (e.g., Channelrhodopsin-2) for activation or proton pumps (e.g., archaerhodopsins) for
