Researchers have suggested that the link between personality traits and Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) could be a crucial factor in understanding the

disorder’s diatheses. The aim of our study was to contribute to research on personality differences (based on fine motor precision – a novel approach) in children with

and without ADHD symptoms. The Children Sustained Attention Task (CSAT) and Proprioceptive Diagnostics of Temperament and Character (DP-TC) were administered

to children with an ADHD diagnosis and age-matched controls. Correlational and ANOVA analyses were performed to see the association between the results of both tests and the groups’ performance.

Proprioceptive Graphomotor Differences in ADHD

MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants

One hundred and five children (37% girls), aged 7-14 years (9.5  1.5) participated in the case-control study with the permission of their parents (with about a 50% split: 52 children with diagnosed ADHD, 13 of whom were not medicated; and 53 as a control group, matched in age and without showing the typical ADHD symptoms according to their parents’ and teachers’ evaluation).

Most of the experimental group sample data was collected thanks to the collaboration of the ADANA Fundació[1,](#_page2_x48.12_y675.50) a foundation which is deeply involved in ADHD and invests much effortand interest in supporting research about this disorder.

The data were treated anonymously and confidentially, following the accepted institutional ethical committees of the participating centers for carrying out the study with consent of the children’s parents.

Instruments

The participants took two types of tests: (a) the CSAT (Children Sustained Attention Task) ([Servera and Llabres, 2004](#_page9_x35.25_y382.10)) and (b) the DP-TC (Proprioceptive Diagnostics of Temperament and Character) ([Tous Ral et al., 2012b](#_page9_x293.63_y192.81)).

CSAT Method

To measure and assess sustained attention, we administered the Children Sustained Attention Task (CSAT), which is a version of the CPTs (continuous performance tests) that measures sustained attention capacity in childhood through a monitoring task. The performance of a subject is evaluated by direct scoring of successes (correct identifications/omissions), errors (false alarms), and reaction time (latent period to response in msecs). The CSAT has been shown to have good psychometric indices (with test–retest reliability ranging from 0.59 to 0.88) and is recommended for application to clinical studies ([Servera and Cardo,](#_page9_x35.25_y363.17) [2006).](#_page9_x35.25_y363.17) As to its validity, the CSAT measures are more related to inattention and academic performance than to hyperactivity itself [(Servera and Cardo, 2006](#_page9_x35.25_y363.17)).

DP-TC Test

**Background and methodology** Weusedtheproprioceptive(myokinetic)indicatorsofindividual differences in personality (mainly endogenous or temperamental ones and those that had changed due to environmental adaptation,whichreflectorarelinkedtocharacter).Thismethod goes back to Mira y López’s initial work, Las correlaciones somáticas del trabajo mental (somatic correlations of mental work) [(Mira, 1923](#_page8_x293.63_y682.97)), some insights of which were later developed in his hypothesis of individual differences in fine motor control. These ideas were confirmed experimentally by Mira y López’s own observation of pilots’ performance ([Liutsko,](#_page8_x293.63_y285.46) [2014](#_page8_x293.63_y285.46)), as well during his work with Luria’s polygraph [(Luria](#_page8_x293.63_y455.82),[ 1932](#_page8_x293.63_y455.82)).![](1e3slbav.006.png)

This all contributed to creating the method of myokinetic psychodiagnosis(MKP) [(Mira, 1958](#_page9_x35.25_y60.30)). The tests that we included intheProprioceptiveDiagnosticsofTemperamentandCharacter (DP-TC) were statistically validated in[ Muiños’](#_page9_x35.25_y107.62)s [(2008](#_page9_x35.25_y107.62)) PhD thesis work. The reliability coefficientswere not very high (test– retest within 30 days), ranging from 0.40 to 0.67, but all were statistically significant [(Tous Ral et al.](#_page9_x293.63_y192.81),[ 2012b](#_page9_x293.63_y192.81);[ Tous Ral and Liutsko, 2014](#_page9_x293.63_y268.52)). DP-TC is a sensitive tool for measuring any slight changes that can occur in human behavior due to either external or internal factors. Human behavior is not stable (especially the emotions), but also can be influenced by many factors. For this reason, coffee consumption and medication intake, for example, were controlled prior to testing. The DP-TC method is a digital version of the MKP Mira y Lopez test (lineograms and parallels), which has fewer errors in output measures since it was digitalized (reducing the human error in measurements). The MKP method itself was used widely during the last century, mainly in exploratory and experimental studies, with more than 300 articles published about it (mostly in Portuguese and Spanish) [(Liutsko, 2014](#_page8_x293.63_y285.46)).

The diagnostic meaning of the MKP results has also been explained by other researchers (e.g.,[ Miroshnikov,](#_page9_x35.25_y69.77) [1973](#_page9_x35.25_y69.77)) and the method has been used in the observation of adaptation processes, such as in the flight of sportsmen to the Far East with a 7 h time difference from their departure point ([Ezhov and Krivoshchekov](#_page8_x35.25_y493.65),[ 2004](#_page8_x35.25_y493.65)).

TousRalwithinthisMirayLopeztradition,alsoattributesthe observed measures in the non-dominant hand to temperamental factors, and those in the dominant hand to character-related factors [(Tous Ral et al.](#_page9_x293.63_y192.81),[ 2012b](#_page9_x293.63_y192.81);[ Tous Ral and Liutsko](#_page9_x293.63_y268.52),[ 2014](#_page9_x293.63_y268.52)). Changes in the precision of fine motor performance can occur due to changes in the environment and/or individual differences [(Tous Ral and Liutsko, 2014](#_page9_x293.63_y268.52)), stress and/or illness in patients with cancer ([Liutsko et al., 2016](#_page8_x293.63_y342.25)), Parkinson’s disease [(Gironell et al., 2012](#_page8_x35.25_y522.05)), multiple sclerosis [(Liutsko and Tous Ral](#_page8_x293.63_y427.43),[ 2013](#_page8_x293.63_y427.43)), and developmental/maturation and aging processes ([Liutsko, 2014](#_page8_x293.63_y285.46);[ Liutsko et al.](#_page8_x293.63_y304.39),[ ](#_page8_x293.63_y304.39)[2014a,b](#_page8_x293.63_y370.64)). Moreover, stress created by the simultaneous performance of tasks, such as the addition of a cognitive task like counting backwards from 100, to a fine motor performance task, also affected the fine motor precision of students on the Irritability dimension of DP-TC, causing an increase in Line Length performance[2 ](#_page2_x306.80_y693.43)similar to what is observed due to aging processes [(Liutsko et al.](#_page8_x293.63_y408.50),[ 2014c](#_page8_x293.63_y408.50)).

Proprioceptive Graphomotor Differences in ADHD

is a difference between the average values for each group’s performance: 61 (ADHD) vs. 29 (control). However, the variance was greater within the ADHD group, showing that this group included participants whose CSAT points ranged from very low (compared with controls) to very high, meaning that some respondersfromtheADHDgroupcouldhaveresultscomparable to or even better than the control group. This concerned only a very limited number of children, since the average results for the ADHD group were worse than the average results of the control group.

A similar situation for intra-group variability (in ADHD only) was observed for reaction time (CSAT), which is congruent with many other studies’ results for reaction time and attention (e.g., [Johnson et al.,](#_page8_x35.25_y692.41) [2007)](#_page8_x35.25_y692.41) and other cognitive tasks (reviewed by[ Tamm et al.](#_page9_x35.25_y401.02),[ 2012](#_page9_x35.25_y401.02)). In our study, the mean values for the two groups are almost identical; the variance for the ADHD group is higher. This point makes it more difficult to compare them quantitatively; nevertheless, it is important for qualitative observation. For this reason, it makes sense to describe the ADHD group as diverse in their individual behaviors for some observable variables: in the CSAT test for reaction time and errors (false identifications), whereas correct detection (good sustained attention) was quite homogeneous in terms of within-group individual variability.

Our results obtained from the DP-TC test confirmthe idea of other authors about personality differences in children with and without ADHD ([Parker et al.,](#_page9_x35.25_y259.06) [2004).](#_page9_x35.25_y259.06) In terms of adaptive vs. less adaptivebehaviorinchildrenwithADHD,wecanseethechanges from more stable (temperamental) features to more flexible ones (character), which show adaptation processes, as the DP-TC variables changed in performance by the non-dominant hand (corresponding to more stable or temperamental characteristics) vs. the dominant hand (corresponding to character or reflecting behavior more reactive to environmental changes) ([Ezhov and Krivoshchekov](#_page8_x35.25_y493.65),[ 2004](#_page8_x35.25_y493.65)[; Tous Ral et al., 2012b](#_page9_x293.63_y192.81)).

The tendency for pessimism on the Mood dimension of the DP-TC was shown in the children from the ADHD group only with the non-dominant hand (-15.48  23.66 mm) if comparing both the dominant one and average values of the control group in both hands). This suggests a more temperamental, endogenous, or biological tendency to pessimism, confirming the idea of[ Caspi et al.](#_page8_x35.25_y275.97) [(2005](#_page8_x35.25_y275.97)) about endogenous temperamental tendencies in the emotions and behavior of children with ADHD. However, this is balanced in the ADHD group, since there were no significant differences observed for the dominant hand (character or more “state” features). These results suggest that for these children (or at least those in the ADHD group), their endogenous temperamental tendency to pessimism was controlled in their current behavioral state.

A similar tendency was also observed for Irritability (inhibition-excitability), which was higher in the non-dominant hand (temperament). In raw average values: Line Length performance was 48.90  15.52 mm in the ADHD group in the non-dominant hand vs. 42.12  15.30 mm in the dominant hand, which was closer to the control group’s performance![ref1]

(42.34 11.73mminthedominanthandvs.43.3  13.33mmin the non-dominant hand), and model Line Length itself (40 mm). Here the tendency to higher endogenous excitability in ADHD children was also somehow adapted, as per the results of the “reactive” hand performance. In both cases we can speak of adaptive, favorable processes that occurred due to education, therapy, and/or medication. Moreover, high excitability does not always have a negative interpretation: People with a high IQ were also found with it ([Liutsko, 2014](#_page8_x293.63_y285.46)).

Nevertheless, two other differences, most significant since they were big and statistically significant, observed between the groups did not have such adaptive changes, since similar results persisted in both hands on the DP-TC dimensions of Emotionality and Behavioral Variability. Greater emotional lability was shown in the ADHD group, indicating congruence with the observations and results mentioned by other authors who mentioned emotional lability and low maturity (compared with a control group of similar ages) in persons with ADHD [(Nigg et al.](#_page9_x35.25_y192.81),[ 2002](#_page9_x35.25_y192.81);[ Martel et al.](#_page8_x293.63_y465.28),[ 2010](#_page8_x293.63_y465.28)[; González et al., 2012](#_page8_x35.25_y607.23)). On the dimension of Behavioral Variability, the results revealed more rigid patterns in the ADHD group average for each group values on the dimension, though with greater variability in individual performance within the same group, indicating non-homogenous individual performance and behavior of these children. Both of these dimensions (Emotionality and Behavioral Rigidness/Flexibility) are important to consider in treatment to reduce the symptoms of ADHD, since they were not shown to have been modified yet by educational or medical interventions (significant differences were shown for both hands).

Correlational Analysis

Withregardtocorrelationanalysis,althoughreactiontime(latent period to reply) was almost identical in the two groups, it had a significant relationship (p < 0.001) to the number of correct answers on the CSAT test in the ADHD group only. However, reaction time had no significant relationship in the controlgroupforcorrectanswers,andthuswasnotsoimportant. This suggests that only the ADHD children, when they respond more quickly, give more correct responses due to a negative sign relationship, and vice versa – the longer they take to respond, the less correct are their responses. Possibly in this context, the longer time spent by the children from the ADHD group on answering (longer latent period to reply) could be related to greater distraction or loss of motivation, with resulting worse scores on the CSAT test. Alternatively, sustained attention and better concentration might be maintained for a short time, while getting worse as the time increased. No similar studies have been performed in this context (showing the relationship between latent response time and correct answers in the children with ADHD), so our results could be considered as the first step in this direction.

A weak but statistically significant relationship was observed only in the control group between Style of Attention (DP-TC) and correct responses (CSAT), meaning that the more attention was paid to the external world, the larger the number of correct

responses on the sustained attention test. This tendency was not as pronounced in the children with ADHD.

Another important tendency that can be considered as an indicator of more pronounced temperamental submission (or less dominance and aggressiveness, DP-TC) in the ADHD group might be related to an increase in correct detection (an indicator of good sustained attention) in the CSAT test (although this correlationdidnotreachastatisticallysignificantvalue, p=0.052, r = -0.26).

Since the Irritability dimension (DP-TC) had a weak, but statistically significant relationship (with a negative sign in both groups) with correct detection on the CSAT, it would be a considerable general feature, however, with more weight (due to a little bit higher correlation value) in the adaptive behavior (dominant hand) of the children with ADHD. Thus, less excitability/more inhibition would be reflected in a higher percentage of correct answers on the CSAT.

No statistically significant relationship was observed between the dimension of Variability in Behavior (DP-TC) and the indicators of good sustained attention, showing that this feature is just an indicator of individual differences between the ADHD and control groups, but this does not greatly influencethe results of the sustained attention test in this study.

Limitations

We analyzed data in the full subgroups, otherwise the sample size would have been reduced significantly, and for this first exploratory study, the aim was to observe the general situation in children. But this approach has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting or generalizing the results. The first is that the range age is quite big and children in the preadolescent period can differ from those who are younger. The second limitation is that we did not have an opportunity to split the groups into other, smaller subgroups, such as different subtypesofADHDorthosechildrentakingmedication,although we controlled for the time of medication uptake and the tests were performed when the least effects of medication were seen (before the next uptake). Finally, the control group consisted of children selected by teachers as “without visible ADHD symptomsortendencies”;theygenerallyalsohadbetteracademic performance and motor coordination than the children with ADHD. Some of the participants in the control group were attending musical or dance classes, which could have been a reason for better proprioceptive motor precision compared to those with ADHD. Thus, further studies are needed with a more homogenous control group, or split by design into those who had better and worse academic and motor performance. Also it would be appropriate to see whether the music or dance classes could be beneficial as an alternative therapy for children with ADHD.

CONCLUSION

Significant individual differences in behavior were observed between the ADHD children and the control group, based on the Proprioceptive Diagnosis of Temperament and Character![ref1]

(DP-TC). Two variables – Mood (endogenous or temperamental tendency to pessimism) and Irritability (endogenous or temperamental tendency to excitability) in the performance of the group with ADHD were shown to be more adaptive, since these tendencies were not pronounced in the subject’s character (dominant hand) and were similar to the control group’s average results. On the other hand, two DP-TC dimensions, Emotionality (higher Emotionality in the ADHD group) and Variability in Behavior (higher rigidness in the average value, but with wider dispersion in interval of individual performance in the ADHD group) were non-adaptive, since the performance persisted at the same level in both hands (non-dominant and dominant) and with a statistically significant difference from the control group. The correlational analysis of the individual differences revealed that not all differences were important for the quality of performance of the sustained attention task, supporting mainly a significant relationship with Irritability (balanced excitability/inhibition) among all of them.

This is an exploratory study and requires more research along these lines and exploration of the Emotionality dimension in children with ADHD. High Emotionality can induce more physical movement among children, which could compensate or be a part of therapy instead. This study is a pioneer in the context of proprioceptive indicators (individual differences in personality) of children with ADHD and the control group of children who have not been so diagnosed, and have better academicaswellasmotorperformance.Theresultscouldprovide an orientation in work with children who are diagnosed with ADHD. Moreover, physical activity and music or art therapy for children with ADHD could be considered means of “emotional discharge,” tohelp them copewith theiremotions, however, more studies with this focus are needed.
