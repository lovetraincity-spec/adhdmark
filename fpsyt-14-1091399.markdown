Introduction: Chronic pain remains a health problem that is difficult to treat adequately. Its unknown cause and complex comorbidity with other illnesses, including mental disorders, amplify the severity of symptoms, which consequently decreases  the  quality  of  life  of  patients  long  term.  In  our  clinical  practice, we  coincidentally  found  evidence  that  methylphenidate  (MPH)  effectively managed  chronic  pain  in  an  adult  patient  with  attention  deficit  hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The effectiveness of MPH in the treatment of ADHD is well- established; however, its utility in treating pain remains unclear.

Case presentation: We present a rare case of a 43-year-old male patient with 15 years of chronic idiopathic pain symptoms that did not adequately respond to standard pain management, such as acetaminophen, non-opioid analgesics, and muscle relaxers. Pain also persisted after treatments with antidepressants and an epidural block. Furthermore, symptoms worsened following several sessions of modified electroconvulsive therapy. After a thorough assessment at our child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic, we confirmed a diagnosis of adult ADHD with a predominantly inattentive type. Considering this newly established diagnosis, we  prescribed  osmotic-release  oral  system  (OROS)  methylphenidate.  Within 1 month of treatment at a dose of 18 mg/day of OROS-MPH, the patient s chronic pain unexpectedly improved dramatically, and the patient no longer experienced pain symptoms. The dosage of OROS-MPH was titrated monthly, reaching 72 mg/ day as a maintenance dose, and ADHD symptoms improved after 4 months of treatment. The patient was followed up regularly for 7 years during his OROS-MPH treatment. No adverse effects were reported, including stimulant addiction. He was stable overall and functioned well in his daily activities. His pain never recurred.

Conclusion: This case report suggests that MPH may be potentially effective in treating chronic pain. Further studies are needed to confirm whether MPH improved chronic pain simultaneously with or separately from the improvement in ADHD. Moreover, elucidating the anatomical sites and molecular pharmacological mechanisms related to the action of MPH in pain modulation and perception is essential. Such sites include the descending dopaminergic pain pathway and higher cortical areas. Furthering our understanding may reinforce the justification for treating chronic pain using MPH.

1. Introduction

Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists or recurs for more than 3 months and affects one or more anatomical regions. It is associated  with  significant  psychological  distress  or  functional disability  in  daily  activity  and  cannot  be  explained  by  another underlying etiology ([1](#_page4_x61.00_y625.89)).  e prevalence is estimated to be 27.5% worldwide  ([2](#_page4_x61.00_y653.89)).  In  addition,  almost  half  of  all  patients  receive inadequate pain management, and more than half of treated patients respond poorly to pain medications ([3)](#_page4_x61.00_y681.89).

Several studies have shown that difficult-to-treat chronic pain is o en associated with mental disorders ( [4](#_page4_x61.00_y709.89)). Around 25.93% of survey respondents had experienced chronic pain while having a mental disorder during their lifetime ([5)](#_page4_x61.00_y737.89). Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common mental disorder that co-occurs with pain  disorders  ([3,](#_page4_x61.00_y681.89)  [5,](#_page4_x61.00_y737.89)  [6)](#_page4_x316.00_y625.89),  is  characterized  by  inattentive  and/or hyperactive  and  impulsive  behaviors,  and  typically  emerges  in childhood and can persist until adulthood ([7,](#_page4_x316.00_y661.89) [8)](#_page4_x316.00_y681.89). Adults with ADHD symptoms have a higher chance of experiencing non-specific pain ([9](#_page4_x316.00_y709.89)), which is likely due to altered pain perception [(10](#_page4_x316.00_y737.89),[ 11](#_page5_x61.00_y74.89)), motor inhibition problems,  and  heightened  muscle  tone  ([12)](#_page5_x61.00_y102.89).  Although  the pathophysiology  of  both  chronic  pain  and  ADHD  involves  the neurochemistry of regions that mediate cognitive and emotional functions ([13](#_page5_x61.00_y130.89)), the specific mechanisms remain unclear.

Many patients with ADHD worldwide are not being treated as early as they should. A population-based study reported that less than 50% of patients with ADHD were treated with medication ([14](#_page5_x61.00_y158.89)). In comorbidity of ADHD and chronic pain, many patients may first present to the clinic with only pain complaints. Treatment that merely focuses on eliminating pain may obscure the diagnosis of ADHD. In addition, untreated ADHD can lead to worsened symptoms, including chronic pain, whereas optimal outcomes can only be achieved by treating all comorbidities that exist as contributors or consequences of chronic pain ([15](#_page5_x61.00_y186.89)).  e first-line treatment for adult patients with ADHD  is  psychostimulants  with  MPH  as  moderately  potent  in reducing ADHD symptoms ([16 ](#_page5_x61.00_y214.89)1[8).](#_page5_x61.00_y294.89) In addition to this property, some  studies  suggested  stimulants,  including  MPH,  may  have antinociceptive effects [(10](#_page4_x316.00_y737.89),[ 19](#_page5_x61.00_y330.89),[ 20](#_page5_x61.00_y366.89)). However, the MPH utility for pain has not been widely investigated.

` `is case report presents an adult patient with comorbid chronic pain and ADHD. Regular treatment with MPH for his newly established ADHD diagnosis led to an unexpected and dramatic improvement in his 15 years of chronic pain complaints within 1 month. To our knowledge, there has only been one similar report of a pediatric case ([21](#_page5_x61.00_y402.89)). However, this is the first well-documented adult case of this association which follows the CARE Guidelines for reporting medical cases in the literature ([22](#_page5_x61.00_y430.89)). We also discuss whether the effectiveness of MPH in treating pain regardless of ADHD comorbidity was likely coincidental or a potentially consistent phenomenon.

2. Case presentation

A 43-year-old, unemployed, unmarried, university graduated, Japanese male patient presented with chronic pain that had recurred and persisted for 15 years at our child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient department a er being referred from an adult psychiatric unit for further ADHD examination in our tertiary hospital.

History of chronic pain symptoms included somatic complaints of chest pain, back pain, and headache, which occurred alternately, and sometimes epigastric pain and nausea.  e pain was evaluated with a numeric rating scale (NRS) score, which ranged from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). Daily, his pain had ranged from 2/10 to 6/10, but mostly 5/10 on average.  e patient had histories of anxiety and depression that preceded pain and received antidepressants at a primary hospital. At the onset of pain, the patient visited a primary healthcare clinic due to chest pain, but the medical examinations revealed no abnormalities.

Consequently, he visited various clinics and received various examinations and medications for the pain. However, none of the treatments  provided  optimal  outcomes.  He  was  referred  to  a psychiatrist  in  a  primary  hospital  and  was  also  prescribed immediate-release MPH (IR-MPH) because of suspected ADHD comorbidity.  With  IR-MPH,  the  patient  reported  dramatic improvement in his pain symptoms with an NRS score of 0/10 and discontinued  the  visit.  When  the  pain  symptoms  recurred, he visited the same hospital and received IR-MPH again, reducing the pain to an NRS of 3/10 on average. However, IR-MPH was discontinued following Japan s drug distribution regulation change, and  his  pain  worsened.  Subsequently,  he  was  referred  to  an anesthesiologist and received oral gabapentin and epidural block therapy, neither of which improved his pain.

He was referred to an adult psychiatrist in our tertiary hospital. Physical  examination,  electroencephalography  (EEG),  and  head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormalities.  e patient insisted on having MPH treatment because he believed it would  improve  his  pain  based  on  his  experience.  However,  his attending  psychiatrist  suspected  an  MPH  dependency  and  thus rejected his request.  e following year, he was hospitalized because his global assessment of functioning (GAF) score was 38 40, with chronic pain and depression. Following discharge, the physician recommended cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but he refused. Subsequently, he consented to modified electroconvulsive therapy (m-ECT), but his pain worsened a er the eighth m-ECT session. 

` `erefore, it was discontinued.

` `roughout  his  medication  history,  he  ever  received acetaminophen, non-opioid analgesics, and various combination of antidepressants. However, combinations of two or three drugs did not adequately alleviate his pain, and MPH is an exception.  e report on detailed medication history could not be obtained from previous physicians, clinics, and hospitals.

` `ere was no family history of chronic pain or neurodevelopmental disorders.  e psychosocial history indicated that during childhood, the  patient  was  forgetful,  careless,  and  had  difficulty  organizing schoolwork tasks. He sometimes forgot his school bag when he went to school. He was not good at maintaining social behavior and had been called a  strange child . However, his parents overlooked his behavioral problems. His condition continued into adulthood, during which he o en changed jobs, was reprimanded for his inadvertent mistakes, and had relational conflicts in the workplace. Regarding the psychological aspects of this case, especially coping strategies, the patient prefers treatment with a clear scientific basis, and willingly received treatments such as drug therapy, nerve blocks, and ECT for his  chronic  pain.  On  the  other  hand,  the  patient  thought  that psychosocial treatments were ineffective, such as he refused cognitive- behavioral therapy.

When  we  examined  the  patient,  his  NRS  was  5/10,  with predominantly chest pain. Current physical, electrocardiography, chest  radiography,  and  laboratory  examinations  revealed  no abnormalities.  us, we suspected that his type of chronic pain was idiopathic. A thorough psychiatric examination led by a child and adolescent psychiatrist resulted in a diagnosis of ADHD.  e patient met  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria for ADHD, predominantly inattentive type, in which eight symptoms of inattention had persisted for 15 years. We used the ADHD Rating Scale (RS)-IV [(23](#_page5_x61.00_y458.89)) with slight adjustments of items to suit an adult patient.  e inattention subscale score was 19.  e delay in the firm diagnosis of ADHD in this patient was likely due to the solely inattentive type, overlooked impact in life, and masked by pain comorbidity.  e Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (2[4) ](#_page5_x61.00_y486.89)scores consisted of verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ), and full scale IQ (FIQ) were 130, 86, and 106, respectively. [Figure 1](#_page2_x39.00_y478.89) shows a timeline of his clinical symptoms and treatments.

Following the ADHD diagnosis, OROS-MPH was started at a titrated dose of 18 mg/day, increasing monthly to 36 mg/day, 54 mg/ day, and up to 72 mg/day as the optimal maintenance dose. In addition, we treated his recurrent depressive episodes with amoxapine 100 mg/day. Flunitrazepam 2 mg/day and etizolam 0.25 mg/day were also prescribed for each of his secondary insomnia and anxiety symptoms in combination or separately when necessary.

A er 1 month of OROS-MPH treatment, he reported no more pain with an NRS score of 0/10 and could resume light activities. A er 4  months,  he  reported  chronic  pain  alleviation  and  inattentive symptoms  improvement  at  work.  His  ADHD-RS-IV  inattention subscale score was 14.

` `e patient has been followed up for the last 7 years and is currently in  peak performance  condition, functioning well in daily activities and attending employment support facilities twice per week. 

His current GAF score is 55, his ADHD-RS-IV inattention subscale score is 11, and his NRS score is 0/10. Regular addiction evaluation using  the  DSM-5  criteria  showed  no  evidence  of  stimulant  use disorder, and the patient adhered to the recommended use and dosage of MPH and indicated no self-medications.  e regular evaluation through anamnesis indicated that the patient could tolerate MPH well, no adverse effects were reported, and his pain never recurred.

3. Discussion

Adult patients with ADHD o en initially present to the clinic with comorbid  symptoms,  which  results  in  difficulties  in  clearly differentiating ADHD during early assessments ([25](#_page5_x61.00_y514.89)). Moreover, not only delayed diagnosis but also treatment is o en seen in clinical practice ([14](#_page5_x61.00_y158.89)). In this case, the prolonged treatments focused on eliminating pain may have obscured ADHD symptoms and caused delayed ADHD treatment. Increasing evidence suggests that ADHD patients experience chronic pain throughout life because they tend to be more sensitive to it ([9](#_page4_x316.00_y709.89)  [11](#_page5_x61.00_y74.89),[ 26](#_page5_x61.00_y550.89)). Moreover, a previous study reported that ADHD increases the risk of chronic pain ([9](#_page4_x316.00_y709.89)), and another study reported that 72.5% of adult patients with chronic pain are newly diagnosed with ADHD ([27](#_page5_x61.00_y578.89)). Previous reports have discussed the association between MPH and pain ([10](#_page4_x316.00_y737.89),[ 11](#_page5_x61.00_y74.89),[ 21](#_page5_x61.00_y402.89),[ 28](#_page5_x61.00_y606.89)). Some studies only reported MPH effects for altering the pain perception of ADHD patients without chronic pain ([10,](#_page4_x316.00_y737.89) [11)](#_page5_x61.00_y74.89), focused on pediatric and adolescent patients ([11](#_page5_x61.00_y74.89),[ 21](#_page5_x61.00_y402.89)), and addressed the risks of stimulant and opioid  abuse  in  ADHD  patients  related  to  pain  ([28)](#_page5_x61.00_y606.89).  However, although from a single case, this report differs from existing literature where we have newly reported the potent effect of MPH in eliminating chronic pain in an adult patient with ADHD. In this case, chronic pain may have been a comorbid condition of ADHD or a completely

independent condition. Regardless, MPH was effective in treating this condition. We offer several potential mechanisms in this regard.

Regarding  neurotransmission  in  chronic  pain,  persistent alterations may occur in the descending modulatory pain pathway without physical abnormalities ([29](#_page5_x61.00_y642.89)).  is pathway is mediated by monoamine  neurotransmitters,  such  as  serotonin  (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA), and inhibits or facilitates pain stimuli transmission at the dorsal horn level ([30](#_page5_x61.00_y670.89)). Following the application of an acute pain stimulus, the descending pain circuitry adjusts its plasticity according to its ability to increase pain inhibition. However, disruption to this inhibitory mechanism results in persistent pain  ([29](#_page5_x61.00_y642.89)).  In  contrast  to  5-HT  and  NE,  the  role  of  DA  in  the descending monoaminergic pain pathway is poorly understood.

Evidence has shown that the descending dopaminergic pathway projecting from the hypothalamic A11 nucleus to the spinal dorsal horn  or  spinal  trigeminal  nucleus  caudalis  plays  a  role  in  pain modulation ([31](#_page5_x61.00_y698.89)), where activation of the A11 nucleus is mediated by D2-like receptors that induce an anti-nociceptive effect ([32](#_page5_x61.00_y734.89)). A study has reported that decreased DA levels likely contribute to chronic pain symptoms  in  Parkinson s  disease  ([33](#_page5_x316.00_y74.89)),  and  levodopa  may  also be effective in alleviating polyneuropathic pain ([34](#_page5_x316.00_y94.89)). Some studies using positron emission tomography found that patients with chronic pain syndromes may be characterized by deficits in presynaptic DA activity [(35](#_page5_x316.00_y122.89)) and tonic DA levels [(36](#_page5_x316.00_y150.89)) or disruptions in DA responses to noxious stimulation ([37](#_page5_x316.00_y186.89)). Given these findings, this patient may have had a DA imbalance that simultaneously caused ADHD and chronic  pain  due  to  descending  dopaminergic  pain  pathway disruptions ([38](#_page5_x316.00_y214.89),[ 39](#_page5_x316.00_y242.89)).

Oral MPH significantly increases extracellular DA in the brain by blockade of the DA transporter, which inhibits reuptake and triggers the amplification of released DA ([40](#_page5_x316.00_y270.89)). Although we did not find evidence  of  direct  MPH  action  sites  along  the  descending  pain pathways, we speculate that MPH increases DA, activating the A11 nucleus to inhibit noxious stimuli.  is effect is mediated by D2 receptors, which have a higher affinity to low DA concentrations [(30](#_page5_x61.00_y670.89)). In addition, A11 lies adjacent to A10 in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the hypothalamus and is a neuroanatomical site of MPH action ([41](#_page5_x316.00_y306.89)). DA may increase because MPH inhibits DA reuptake by blocking NE transporters, which have a high affinity for DA in specific brain regions ([42](#_page5_x316.00_y334.89)).  ere was also a case of an adult patient with ADHD  and  generalized  pain  from  fibromyalgia  syndrome  who responded dramatically to atomoxetine, a selective NE reuptake inhibitor, with a 60% pain reduction ([43](#_page5_x316.00_y370.89)). However, as NE and 5-HT increase  descending  pain  inhibition  ([30)](#_page5_x61.00_y670.89),  antidepressant  drugs possessing properties that inhibit 5-HT and NE reuptake initially prescribed to this patient did not alleviate the pain.  erefore, this patient s  pain  was  likely  related  primarily  to  the  descending dopaminergic pathway.

From a functional neuroimaging perspective, the descending pain pathway integrates cognitive and emotional outputs from higher cortical areas, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insular cortex (IC), and amygdala ([29](#_page5_x61.00_y642.89)). It is suggested that the mesolimbic DA pathway, which is involved in the reward system, is essential in pain modulation and perception ([44 ](#_page5_x316.00_y398.89)4[6),](#_page5_x316.00_y454.89) which may be impaired in ADHD ([38](#_page5_x316.00_y214.89)). Furthermore, the amygdala is an essential structure in pain  integration  ([47)](#_page5_x316.00_y474.89),  and  the  IC  contributes  to  the  affective- motivational aspects of pain sensory-discriminative functions and simultaneously activates cognitive areas, such as the prefrontal cortex 

(PFC) and ACC, to shape pain perception ([48)](#_page5_x316.00_y494.89).  ese areas are hyperactivated in ADHD patients in response to negative emotional stimuli ([49](#_page5_x316.00_y522.89)), including pain. Moreover, alterations in gray matter density, connectivity, and activity in mesolimbic areas, PFC, and ACC are characteristics of both chronic pain ([50](#_page5_x316.00_y550.89), [51](#_page5_x316.00_y578.89)) and ADHD ([52](#_page5_x316.00_y606.89)). In ADHD patients, MPH improves the hypodopaminergic state of the PFC and limbic system [(53](#_page5_x316.00_y642.89)) and increases DA activity in the parietal cortex, PFC, and striatum, which regulate cognitive functions ([54](#_page5_x316.00_y670.89),[ 55](#_page5_x316.00_y706.89)).  erefore, MPH may indirectly improve the integration of cognitive and emotional outputs during pain modulation and perception, particularly in the abovementioned brain regions.

Although MPH use as an analgesic for pain treatment remains uncommon  and  off-label,  several  studies  have  investigated  its antinociceptive effect. A double-blind, randomized controlled study showed that the antinociceptive effect of MPH significantly increases the cold pain threshold and tolerance in healthy men ([19)](#_page5_x61.00_y330.89). In addition, a study in traumatic brain injury patients reported a slight decrease in pain intensity following a standard dose of MPH ([20](#_page5_x61.00_y366.89)). Another study reported that in one of two patients undergoing ongoing opioid treatment for cancer, the pain intensity and frequency decreased during a 3-week observation with MPH combination therapy ([56)](#_page5_x316.00_y742.89). Other studies have reported that ADHD is less prevalent than other mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders, in chronic pain populations ([5, ](#_page4_x61.00_y737.89)[57, ](#_page6_x61.00_y74.89)[58)](#_page6_x61.00_y102.89). In this patient, chronic pain improved dramatically within 1 month, followed by improvement  in  attention  a er  4  months.  e  varied  course  of improvement suggests that the mechanisms underlying the effect of MPH in treating chronic pain and ADHD may be independent.

Although potentially effective, the use of MPH requires caution because of the side effects of abuse and addiction [(59](#_page6_x316.00_y74.89)).  e benefits of offering patients MPH as a primary therapy must outweigh the risks. Although this patient was initially suspected of having an MPH addiction,  the  course  of  illness  and  substantial  long-term  pain management ruled out addiction. Apart from that, viewing this case from the psychological aspect, another possibility to consider is the psychological nature of placebo analgesia. However, the placebo effect could also be physiological, in which the dopaminergic systems are likely implicated in placebo pain relief [(60](#_page6_x316.00_y102.89)). In addition, because ADHD is a comorbidity in this case, thus a dopaminergic system abnormality is still more likely to be suspected. However, assuming the placebo effect, we cannot further provide the scientific explanation that MPH exclusively exhibited such an effective outcome compared to other treatments previously given.

We acknowledge the limitation that this report is merely based on a single case whose outcome may not be generalized to all cases. Although we have shown and discussed the possible mechanisms by which MPH alleviates chronic pain, current evidence is insufficient because of the comorbidity with ADHD.  us further research in this field is required. In addition, we could not obtain precise and detailed information entirely about the diagnosis and medication before the patient was referred to us. However, the information presented by the patient was sufficient to understand the course of the disease.

In conclusion, MPH may be potentially effective in treating chronic pain. It is suggested that physicians should be aware of a potential ADHD diagnosis when managing patients with chronic pain with inadequate response to treatment. Conversely, in the case of MPH independently alleviating chronic pain, randomized control trial (RCT) is needed in patients with pain without ADHD, following

the result of a previous RCT study that reported the antinociceptive effect  of  MPH,  which  significantly  increased  the  threshold  and tolerance to cold pain in healthy subjects ([19](#_page5_x61.00_y330.89)). Finally, determining the anatomical sites and molecular pharmacological mechanisms underlying the effect of MPH on pain modulation and perception, such  as  the  descending  dopaminergic  pain  pathway  and  higher cortical areas, may justify treating chronic pain using MPH.

4. Patient perspective

Before treatment, the patient described pain mainly in his chest. At its worst, his pain lasted all day, and he was sometimes unable to sleep. While in pain, he was unable to concentrate on daily activities. A er OROS-MPH treatment, the pain disappeared completely. His pain symptoms never recurred, even on days when he forgot to take OROS-MPH.

Furthermore, his ADHD symptoms improved. He makes fewer mistakes, is less forgetful, and can concentrate on tasks better. He does not  experience  the  short-term  craving-like  sensations  with OROS-MPH that he experienced with IR-MPH and feels better about taking  it  long-term  without  side  effects.  Overall,  he  considers OROS-MPH a necessary drug.
