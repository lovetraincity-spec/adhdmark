**This cross-sectional epidemiological internet survey assessed whether attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms are associated with pain chronicity and intensity and explored the relationship between developmental disorder symptoms and pain. Participants were 4028 adults aged 20–64 years who experienced pain, assessed using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), in any body part in the previous 4 weeks. ADHD and ASD symptoms were assessed using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and autism spectrum quotient, respectively. Problems with mental health (PMH) were assessed using the shortened Profile of Mood States. Pathway analyses were performed to examine the association between ADHD symptoms and pain. The chronic pain symptoms (CP) group (*N* = 1465) scored higher than the non-CP group (*N* = 2563) for all ASRS variables. ASRS positivity was associated with CP symptoms and increased with increasing NRS score; the CP group showed particularly high positivity (38.3%) with extreme pain. ADHD symptoms were more strongly associated with CP symptoms and intensity than was PMH (0.26 vs. 0.09). ADHD symptoms, but not ASD symptoms, were associated with CP symptoms. ADHD medications reportedly improve coexisting CP; therefore, ADHD screening and treatment may be important for patients with CP, especially those with extreme pain.**

In 2022, chronic pain (CP) based on the International Association for the Study of Pain definition was first coded as a disease in the International Classification of Diseases (11th edition) (I[CD-11)1](#_page10_x155.00_y58.36),[2](#_page10_x155.00_y75.36). CP was defined 

as  pain that persists or recurs for > 3 months,  while pain lasting < 3 months was classified as acute pain. A key feature of the ICD-11 CP classification is the introduction of two subcategories: chronic primary pain and chronic secondary pain. Chronic primary pain includes conditions such as fibromyalgia and nonspecific chronic low back pain, where the pain cannot be fully explained by an underlying pathological condition alone. Chronic primary pain refers to pain that persists for > 3 months with significant emotional distress, such as anxiety, depression, or anger, and impairment of daily and social functioning, without apparent tissue damage causing pain[3](#_page10_x155.00_y83.36). In contrast, chronic secondary pain is attributed to an identifiable organic cause.  is classification is aimed at standardizing the diagnosis of CP, which used to be categorized under mental disorders in earlier versions of the ICD, and to clarify treatment strategies, promote research advancements, and ultimately improve patient care. CP can also be influenced by psychosocial factors and has a low improvement rate with the use of usual analgesics, making it an important and challenging issue for society and clinician[s4](#_page10_x155.00_y92.36).

Recently, studies have focused on the association between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and CP classified as chronic primary pain in the ICD-11[5](#_page10_x155.00_y100.36), such as migraine[6](#_page10_x155.00_y109.36), fibromyalgi[a6](#_page10_x155.00_y109.36),[7](#_page10_x155.00_y125.36), irritable bowel

syndrome[6](#_page10_x155.00_y109.36), chronic low back pain[8](#_page10_x155.00_y142.36) [11,](#_page10_x155.00_y193.36) and idiopathic orofacial pain[12 ](#_page10_x155.00_y218.36)[14. ](#_page10_x155.00_y251.36)ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity[15,](#_page10_x155.00_y268.36) which is assumed to be due to dopaminergic and noradrenergic nervous system dysfunction[16.](#_page10_x155.00_y285.36) ADHD symptoms are present from childhood, before 12 years of age, and 40 70% of these symptoms persist to various degrees into adulthood[17](#_page10_x155.00_y302.36). As dopamine and noradrenaline are important for pain perception and control[18, ](#_page10_x155.00_y319.36)individuals with ADHD may be more vulnerable to pain[19](#_page10_x155.00_y327.36). Basic research has also revealed that in rodent models of ADHD, brain abnormalities associated with ADHD lead to central sensitization and hyperalgesia through several neurobiological mechanisms[19](#_page10_x155.00_y327.36) [23.](#_page10_x155.00_y394.36)  ese include increased spontaneous activity in the anterior cingulate cortex posterior insular cortex pathway due to neuroinflammation, alterations in action potential firing and transmission pathways in the spinal dorsal horn, as well as upregulated norepinephrine synthesis and reduced transmission efficiency.  ese changes are thought 

to amplify nociceptive input from the periphery, which ultimately contributes to heightened pain sensitivity.

Studies on pain and ADHD in humans have mostly been conducted in clinical settings. To the best of our knowledge, a study by Stickley et al. is the only epidemiological study conducted in a more general, non-clinical setting.  ey showed that ADHD symptoms are associated with pain in a general population of 7403 individuals 

in England[24](#_page10_x155.00_y411.36). In this study, pain intensity was assessed by asking participants,  During the past 4 weeks, how much did pain interfere with your normal work?   e response options were  not at all,   a little bit,   moderately,  

` `quite a bit,  and  extremely.  For the analysis, the responses were treated as a binary variable, with responses of  extremely  categorized as extreme pain and all other responses categorized as non-extreme pain. Logistic regression analysis revealed ADHD as a significant predictor of extreme pain. However, a er adjusting for common mental disorders (CMDs), the association with CMDs was stronger, reducing the effect of ADHD.  e authors suggest that CMDs can mediate this relationship, highlighting the importance of CMD screening and treatment in ADHD patients with pain.

However, this study had three key limitations. First, individuals were categorized as having  ADHD symptoms  on the basis of a cutoff score of 14 or higher out of 24 on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (AS[RS)25](#_page10_x155.00_y428.36), rather 

than on the basis of the screener score that is specifically designed for ADHD screening.  e ASRS screener score (ranging from 0 to 6) has established sensitivity and specificity based on the probability of a clinical ADHD diagnosis at each score level. By utilizing this screener score, it would be possible to estimate the proportion of participants who might meet the criteria for an ADHD diagnosis. Hence, the findings of this study do not allow for an examination of the association between pain and the likelihood of an ADHD diagnosis. Second, the researchers assessed pain by asking about its interference with work, rather than evaluating actual pain occurrence using a validated pain scale. In addition, the authors highlighted the need for more data on pain duration, chronicity, and location, suggesting that future studies collecting such details would provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between pain and ADHD.  ird, the need for additional research to determine whether a causal relationship exists between ADHD and pain was emphasized.

Furthermore, ADHD frequently coexists with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)[26](#_page10_x155.00_y445.36). ASD is characterized by persistent deficits in social interaction and communication, in addition to limited and repetitive patterns of behavior and interest[15](#_page10_x155.00_y268.36); ASD also has symptoms of sensory hypersensitivity and is reportedly associated with CP[27](#_page10_x155.00_y461.36). However, in no epidemiological studies have the authors reported on the association between pain and adult developmental disorders, including ADHD and ASD. Furthermore, a potential causal link between ADHD and CP has not been thoroughly examined.

` `erefore, we raised two clinical questions: (1) Are ADHD and ASD associated with pain chronicity and intensity, and if so, which has the stronger influence? (2) If developmental disorders and pain are associated, what potential pathways can be explored to understand their relationship? By addressing these questions and bridging the gaps in the literature, we aimed to clarify how symptoms of developmental disorders influence CP. With this objective in mind, we conducted a cross-sectional epidemiological internet survey using large population-based data.

**Results**

**Sample characteristics**

Data from all 4028 participants in this study were analyzed; their characteristics are presented in Table[ 1](#_page2_x118.00_y47.36). Overall, 50.3% of the participants were male, and the median age of all participants was 45 (34 54) years.  ere were 1465 (36.4%) participants in the CP symptoms group and 2563 (63.6%) in the non-CP symptoms group.  e pain intensity in the CP symptoms group was significantly higher [6 (5,7)] than that in the non-CP symptoms group [4 (3,6)]. More participants were married, divorced, or widowed in the CP symptoms group than in the non-CP symptoms group. Problems with physical health (PPH) and problems with mental health (PMH) were significantly more common in the CP symptoms group than in the non-CP symptoms group.  e distributions 

of the most troublesome areas of pain in the last 4 weeks and that of the areas where the pain became chronic are shown in Fig.[ 1](#_page2_x155.00_y386.36).  e top 3 sites for both the most troubling pain areas in the last 4 weeks and the sites where pain became chronic included the back, neck, and shoulders.

**Association between ADHD and ASD symptoms and pain**

` `e CP symptoms group had significantly higher ASRS scores than the non-CP symptoms group did for all variables, although no significant differences were noted in autism spectrum quotient (AQ) scores between the groups (Table [2](#_page3_x135.00_y47.36)). Significantly fewer participants with CP symptoms were categorized as ADHD and ASD symptom-negative, and significantly more participants with CP symptoms were categorized as only ADHD symptom-positive, according to the adjusted residuals; that is, screening positive for only ADHD symptoms was significantly associated with CP symptoms. Regarding the ASRS score, ADHD symptom positivity increased significantly with increasing pain stage in the entire cohort, non-CP symptoms group, and CP symptoms group (Fig.[ 2](#_page4_x71.00_y47.36)). In the CP symptoms group, 38.3% of respondents with pain reported as numerical rating scale (NRS)

grade 5 (NRS score = 9 10) screened positive for ADHD symptoms. Conversely, no significant association was noted between pain grade and screening positive for ASD symptoms in the entire cohort, non-CP symptoms group, and CP symptoms group.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis using the binary pain variable (having extreme pain or not) as the outcome revealed a significant association between ADHD symptom positivity and extreme pain (Table [3](#_page6_x155.00_y47.36)). In an unadjusted model where the covariate was ADHD symptoms only (Model 1), the odds of having extreme pain were over threefold higher for those who were ADHD symptom-positive than for those who were ADHD symptom-negative (OR: 3.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.43 5.58). In the unadjusted model with ASD symptoms as the only covariate (Model 2), there was no association between extreme pain and ASD symptoms (OR: 1.38, 95% CI 0.78 2.43). In the model with ADHD and ASD symptoms as covariates (Model 3), the odds of having extreme pain were significant only for ADHD symptom-positive participants (OR: 3.68, 95% CI 2.40 5.63). Even a er adjusting for all the demographic variables (Model 4) and including PPH (Model 5), the odds of ADHD symptoms being associated with extreme pain remained at or above 3.0. However, when PMH was included in the analysis, the odds of ADHD symptom-positive individuals reporting extreme pain was significantly attenuated (Models 6 and 7). In the fully adjusted model (Model 7), the OR decreased to 2.73 (1.73 4.31). Hence, ADHD symptoms were significantly associated with having extreme pain in all models that included it as a variable (Models 1, 2 7), although the association was significantly attenuated when PMH was included (Models 6 and 7).

**Association between ADHD symptoms and CP symptoms and intensity**

ADHD symptoms were associated with both PMH and CP symptoms and intensity.  e overall association between ADHD symptoms and CP symptoms and intensity (0.26; indirect effect 0.04 + direct effect 0.23) was stronger than the association between PMH and pain (0.09) (Fig. 3; Tables[ 4](#_page7_x155.00_y47.36) and [5](#_page7_x155.00_y167.36)).

**Discussion**

Herein, we found that ADHD symptoms were associated with pain chronicity and intensity, and we formulated a statistical model to examine the potential relationship between ADHD symptoms and CP symptoms and intensity.

First, the screening positivity rates for both the AQ and ASRS among participants with pain (ASD symptoms, 8.8%; ADHD symptoms, 9.9%) were higher than those in the general population found in a previous internet study  (ASD  symptoms,  4.3%;  ADHD  symptoms,  [7.2%)28](#_page10_x155.00_y470.36).  Moreover,  contrary  to  ASD  symptoms,  ADHD symptoms were associated with pain chronicity and intensity (especially extreme pain). As noted previousl[y27](#_page10_x155.00_y461.36), people with ASD symptoms may be less sensitive to pain.

Patients with extreme pain are known to have a longer history of pain, longer functional disability, more surgical procedures and hospitalizations, higher rates of drug dependence, more pronounced pain behaviors, and less responsiveness to treatment than do those with mild pain [29](#_page10_x155.00_y487.36). Recent epidemiological studies on the economic cost of CP have revealed that the direct cost of healthcare utilization is 1.78 4.45 times higher, the indirect cost of lost productivity 34.62 times higher, and the total cost 15.96 times higher for people with extreme pain than for those with mild pain[30,](#_page10_x155.00_y495.36)[31.](#_page10_x155.00_y512.36)  e excess annual cost would be  308.88 for mild pain and  4928.70 for extreme pain per case, making this an important social issue[31](#_page10_x155.00_y512.36).  e finding of an association between extreme pain and ADHD symptoms is important from both medical and economic perspectives and useful for the future development of new approaches.

Furthermore, herein, the association between ADHD symptoms and pain was mediated by PMH, which is consistent with the findings of a previous study[24](#_page10_x155.00_y411.36). Adults with ADHD are more likely to have comorbid psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety disorders and PMH [32](#_page10_x155.00_y529.36), which could exacerbate pain.

Second, a significant statistical model was identified, which suggested a potential association between ADHD symptoms and pain, with ADHD symptoms accounting for approximately 26% of the variance in CP symptoms and intensity. Traditionally, it has been assumed that CP is caused by the presence of PMH, such as anxiety or depression[33](#_page10_x155.00_y545.36), as ADHD has not been included in the discussion of the association between CP and mental illness. However, the consideration of ADHD symptoms in the present study revealed that its association with CP symptoms and intensity (0.26) was stronger than that of PMH (0.09).  is finding is consistent with our multivariate logistic regression analysis results, which showed a significant association of ADHD symptoms with extreme pain a er adjusting for PMH, although it was attenuated by PMH.  e authors of previous studies have stated that screening and intervention for CMDs are important because such disorders mediate the association between pain and ADHD symptoms[24.](#_page10_x155.00_y411.36) Our results suggest that screening and intervention for ADHD symptoms should also be considered.

` `e ASRS scores were significantly higher in the CP symptoms group than in the non-CP symptoms group,      particularly among those who reported extreme pain, with a positive ADHD symptom screening rate of 38.3%.  e ASRS has a sensitivity and specificity of 68.7% and 99.5%, respectively, indicating relatively low sensitivity and a high false-negative rat[e25](#_page10_x155.00_y428.36). If the participants  ADHD symptoms had been clinically assessed, an estimated 57.45% of those with extreme pain in the CP symptoms group might have met the criteria for a theoretical diagnosis of adult ADHD. Although the theoretical ADHD diagnostic rate of 57.45% among those with extreme pain may appear high, it could be considered plausible given that the comorbidity of ADHD in individuals with refractory chronic primary pain in clinical settings has been reported to be 72.5%[5](#_page10_x155.00_y100.36). CP and ADHD are similar in terms of dysfunction of the dopaminergic and noradrenergic nervous systems[16,](#_page10_x155.00_y285.36)[18.](#_page10_x155.00_y319.36) ADHD medications    activate the dopaminergic and noradrenergic nerves in the brain[34,](#_page10_x155.00_y562.36) and recent human studies have revealed that     ADHD medications improve CP comorbid with ADHD[5,](#_page10_x155.00_y100.36)[10 ](#_page10_x155.00_y176.36)[14,](#_page10_x155.00_y251.36)[35. ](#_page10_x155.00_y579.36)Additionally, it has been shown that ADHD    medications improve the increased blood flow in the precuneus of individuals with CP comorbid with ADHD, which may consequently lead to the improvement of reduced blood flow in the prefrontal cortex[36](#_page10_x155.00_y596.36). It has also been demonstrated in rodent models of ADHD that hyperalgesia due to central sensitization, along with ADHD symptoms such as hyperactivity and inattention, can be improved by atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used for ADHD treatment [20](#_page10_x155.00_y344.36),[23](#_page10_x155.00_y394.36). Currently, however, 80% of adult ADHD cases are missed, even in psychiatric practice[37](#_page10_x155.00_y613.36).  erefore, proactive ADHD screening and treatment could be beneficial for patients      with CP, especially those who experience extreme pain; this may also contribute to reducing economic costs.

Furthermore, the association between ADHD and pain can be considered from an evolutionary and genetic perspective.  e seven-repeat subclass (DRD4-7R) of the dopamine receptor DRD4, one of the genes responsible for ADHD, is associated with novelty-seeking and is known to correlate with the distance of human migration from Africa[38](#_page10_x155.00_y629.36). Perhaps because ADHD is characterized by risk-taking and venturing into uncharted territory, patients with the condition may be acutely sensitive to pain, a signal indicating potential injury, illness, or physical discomfort.

` `is study has four limitations.  e first is the potential sampling bias in participant recruitment through web-

based surveys, such as in this study, wherein individuals without internet access cannot participate. Registrants interested in their health may have been more likely to respond to our survey.  erefore, participants may have overestimated their pain and ADHD symptoms, leading to exaggerated effects of ADHD symptoms on CP symptoms. Furthermore, it should be noted that the registered participants were limited to those who reported pain in the 4 weeks before the time of the survey, and individuals who did not report pain were not included. Second, ADHD symptoms in this study may have been non-clinical, as they were self-reported rather than based on a clinical diagnosis. Moreover, the ADHD and ASD symptoms assessed in this study using standardized scales reflect current symptoms only and do not confirm their presence since childhood.  e diagnosis of developmental disorders requires verification that symptoms have been present since early childhood.  erefore, the ADHD and ASD symptoms identified in this study cannot be equated with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD or ASD.  ird, the inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity classified as ADHD symptoms in this study, as well as the communication difficulties and restricted/repetitive behaviors classified as ASD symptoms, are not exclusively observed in individuals with ADHD or ASD.  ese symptoms could result from other conditions, such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities, or language disorders, which could contribute to difficulties in social situations[39](#_page10_x155.00_y646.36). Fourth, as this study had a cross-sectional design, the temporal order of factors in the path analysis remains unclear, and unmeasured confounding factors cannot be ruled out. Additionally, bidirectional causal relationships between factors are conceivable.  erefore, definitive 

conclusions about causality cannot be drawn solely based on the findings of this study.  ese points should be considered when generalizing our findings.

In conclusion, although previous studies on the association between ADHD, ASD, and CP are limited, this study provides a detailed analysis of the relationship between ADHD symptoms and CP symptoms, demonstrating that ADHD symptoms are particularly associated with pain severity. In contrast, ASD symptoms did not show a clear association with CP symptoms.  is study was conducted using a large-scale internet survey and a sample of 4028 adults, incorporating a relatively diverse population.  is aspect suggests that the findings of this study are not restricted to a specific group but may be generalizable to a broader population. Furthermore, given previous reports that ADHD treatment may influence CP management, our study provides empirical evidence supporting the potential utility of ADHD screening and treatment considerations in the clinical management of CP and relevant policymaking. Psychiatrists, pain physicians, orthopedic specialists, and professionals who are involved in occupational health, welfare, and policy may benefit from these findings. Screening and intervention for PMH and ADHD could play a role in managing CP. Future research on the relationship between ADHD and CP is required, including clinical longitudinal studies and research on the biological mechanisms of pain from the perspective of ADHD.

**Methods**

**Study population**

We conducted a cross-sectional web-based epidemiological study among Japanese adults from July 29, 2020, to August 19, 2020.  e participants were recruited through internet research agency Hamon Co. (Kanagawa, Japan) using the JAPAN Cloud Panel [(https://gmo-research.ai/service/panel/jcp](https://gmo-research.ai/service/panel/jcp)), a large-scale online research panel operated by GMO Research, Inc.  is panel consists of approximately 23.94 million registered monitors as of August 2023, covering a diverse range of demographic backgrounds.  e sample included individuals aged 20 64 years, with a balanced distribution of sex (male and female) and geographic regions across Japan.  e panel members have provided detailed demographic information, including occupation, household income, educational background, and lifestyle habits. Furthermore, periodic updates and screening surveys ensure that the registered data remain current and reliable.

` `e participants were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria: (1) age 20 64 years and (2) experience 

of pain in any body part in the previous 4 weeks.  e inclusion age is based on the Japanese age standards (adults = 20 years; older adults = 65 years) given that the study population included working adults. Pain in any body part was considered, as CP can occur in various body parts[40](#_page10_x155.00_y663.36). In studies assessing pain prevalence[41](#_page10_x155.00_y680.36), the customary timepoints used are  at the time of the survey,   a er 4 weeks,  or  a er 1 year  we employed the 

most universally used period (4 weeks).  e exclusion criteria were (1) inability to provide consent, (2) age < 20 years or ≥ 65 years, and (3) absence of physical pain in the previous 4 weeks.  is recruitment method, conducted in collaboration with Hamon Co., ensures a broad representation of the Japanese population while maintaining high data reliability through rigorous quality control measures implemented by the research panel provider.

Recruitment emails were sent to 103,556 panelists who were stratified according to sex and age. Questionnaires were accessible to those who consented to participate. Missing or incomplete responses were automatically rejected, generating no missing data. Participants who completed the questionnaire were awarded reward points worth 0.52 USD as an incentive.  e reported prevalence of high-impact CP (HICP) is 4.8%[40; ](#_page10_x155.00_y663.36)the sample size was set at 4000 to ensure 200 HICP events, allowing for multivariate analysis.  e survey was closed a er reaching 4028 respondents, determined broadly according to the Japanese population distribution (sex and age).

` `is study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of  e University of Tokyo (No. 2019296NI), and informed consent for participation in this study was obtained from all the study participants.

**Measurements**

Pain

Participants were asked about their pain, the areas where they had experienced pain in the last 4 weeks (using manikin drawings, with each of the 11 body parts assigned a color; multiple areas could be selected), and the area of pain that troubled them most. For the most troublesome area, the average pain intensity was assessed using an 11-point NRS[42](#_page10_x155.00_y697.36) (0 = no pain, 10 = most extreme pain).

Pain chronicity

Participants were asked how o en over the last 3 months they experienced pain at any site where they had pain in the last 4 weeks.  e possible responses were: (1) never, (2) for a few days, (3) almost every day, and (4) every day. Based on the ICD-11 definition of CP mentioned earlier, participants who answered with responses (3) and (4) were included in the CP symptoms group, and those who answered with responses (1) and (2) were included in the non-CP symptoms group. Additionally, participants were asked to indicate, using the 11 color-coded areas on the manikin diagrams, areas where they experienced persistent pain for > 3 months.

ADHD symptoms were assessed using the AS[RS25](#_page10_x155.00_y428.36), which was developed by the World Health Organization and is freely available.  e ASRS comprises 9 inattentive and 9 hyperactive-impulsive questions corresponding to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision ADHD diagnostic criteria. Each question is scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 for  never  to 4 for  very o en,  and an inattention score (0 36), hyperactivity-impulsivity score (0 36), and Q18 total score (0 72) are derived. In the screener consisting of 6 (4 inattentive and 2 hyperactive-impulsive) of these questions, a positive result was obtained if four or more answers were within the set score range and a diagnosis of adult ADHD was highly possible.  e reported sensitivity and specificity of the ASRS screener are 68.7% and 99.5%, respective[ly25](#_page10_x155.00_y428.36).

ASD symptoms

ASD symptoms were assessed using the A[Q43](#_page10_x155.00_y713.36), which comprises 50 questions and a score range of 0 50.  e AQ has five subscales: social skills, attention switching, attention to detail, communication, and imagination. A score of ≥ 33 is considered a positive screening score and a likely diagnosis of ASD.  e Japanese version has a reported sensitivity and specificity of 87.8% and 97.4%, respective[ly43](#_page10_x155.00_y713.36).

Problems with physical health

Information on the following physician-diagnosed medical problems was collected: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, postherpetic neuralgia, malignancy, and others. Participants who selected any of these items were judged to have PPH.

Problems with mental health

Mood states were assessed using the short version of the Profile of Mood States (PO[MS)44](#_page11_x155.00_y47.36), which comprises 30 questions and has 6 subscales (Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Vigor, Fatigue, and Confusion). Participants with a T-score of ≥ 75 on any of the five negative subscales Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection,  Anger-Hostility,  Fatigue,  or  Confusion indicating  a  clinical  psychiatric  level,  were judged to have PMH. Additionally, in the path analysis, we calculated the Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score, a comprehensive indicator of mood disorders, based on the scores of each POMS subsca[le45](#_page11_x155.00_y64.36).  e TMD score was computed as follows: TMD = (Tension-Anxiety + Depression-Dejection + Anger-Hostility + Fatigue + Confusion)   Vigor.

**Statistical analyses**

Data  normality  was  assessed  using  the  Kolmogorov Smirnov Lilliefors  test;  no  variables  were  normally distributed. Hence, all continuous variables are presented as medians (25th percentile, 75th percentile).  e participant characteristics were compared between the CP symptoms and non-CP symptoms groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. Additionally, because ADHD symptoms and ASD symptoms can coexist, a chi-square test was conducted on the association between the combination of ADHD and ASD symptom screening results and CP symptoms. For marital status and combined ADHD and ASD symptom screening results, adjusted residuals were calculated, and significant differences were found.

To examine the association between pain intensity stages and the percentage of positive screening for ADHD and ASD symptoms, the chi-square test was conducted; the NRS score was categorized as follows: 0 for grade 0, 1 2 for grade 1, 3 4 for grade 2, 5 6 for grade 3, 7 8 for grade 4, and 9 10 for grade 5.

To examine the association between pain intensity and ADHD and ASD symptoms, ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Previous epidemiological studies have shown that extreme pain has a significant impact on the economic cost of CP[30](#_page10_x155.00_y495.36),[31](#_page10_x155.00_y512.36). In line with previous research[24](#_page10_x155.00_y411.36), we dichotomized the outcome of the logistic regression analysis by classifying an NRS score of 9 10 as  with extreme pain  and 0 8 as  without extreme pain.   e covariates included variables that were reported as significant in 

a previous study[24](#_page10_x155.00_y411.36) age, sex, education, and working economic status as well as body mass index and marital status, which showed significant differences in terms of CP symptoms in the present study. A hierarchical analysis was conducted wherein each block of variables was entered sequentially into the model to adjust for confounding factors, and seven different models were constructed.

Based on the logistic regression results, a pathway analysis was conducted to examine the causal relationship between pain, ADHD symptoms, and PMH. ADHD symptoms were assessed using the total ASRS Q18 score (0 72 points). PMH was evaluated using the TMD score of the POMS (− 20 to 100 points). Pain chronicity was defined as a binary variable based on whether the pain frequency was  every/almost every day for 3 months  or not. Pain intensity was assessed using the NRS score for pain (0 10 points). For the identification of paths in the model, the best-fitting model was selected based on the fit indices (BCC0, BIC0, C/df, p-value) obtained from the analysis using the  Exploratory Model Specification  command in AMOS 28 (Supplementary File S1).  e goodness-of-fit of the overall model was assessed using chi-square values, the goodness-of-fit index, comparative fit index, Tucker Lewis Index, and root mean square error of approximation.

All statistical analyses were performed using JMP Pro version 16 (SAS Institute Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and AMOS 28 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Statistical significance for all analyses was set atP < 0.05 with a two-tailed test. For multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction was used.
